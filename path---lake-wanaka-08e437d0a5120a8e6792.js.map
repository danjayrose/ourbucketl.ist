We were able to see some of the Pisa Ranges in Aspiring National Park and we had a great view of the lake.

However, the majority of the time we were in Wanaka the summit of the mountain was covered in cloud so we knew we’d have terrible views over the lake and surrounding mountain ranges. The other problem was that as it was winter the summit was covered in snow and ice so we’d been advised to go as far as we could and we’d then have to turn around. With no guarantee as to how high we’d get up there and what kind of view we’d have we gave it a miss and opted for a walk around the lake.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/lake-wanaka-e4b08b1e4c79606f9b1f3e22b6417d82-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Lake Wanaka\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Lake Wanaka\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/lake-wanaka-e4b08b1e4c79606f9b1f3e22b6417d82-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/lake-wanaka-e4b08b1e4c79606f9b1f3e22b6417d82-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/lake-wanaka-e4b08b1e4c79606f9b1f3e22b6417d82-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/lake-wanaka-e4b08b1e4c79606f9b1f3e22b6417d82-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>We headed in the direction of Glendhu Bay but never made it that far round. We hiked in total for 16km and went as far as Ironside Hill, a steep hill coming out into the bay. The view from the top was glorious especially as we had a bit of blue sky and a hint of sunshine. We were able to see some of the Pisa Ranges in Aspiring National Park and we had a great view of the lake. The only downside was that the hill was so steep I went down most of it on my arse, slipping right at the end, covering my leggings in mud and rabbit droppings.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/ironside-hill-d2ab5e2039096407f86aeda2885fb9a1-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Ironside Hill\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Ironside Hill\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/ironside-hill-d2ab5e2039096407f86aeda2885fb9a1-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/ironside-hill-d2ab5e2039096407f86aeda2885fb9a1-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/ironside-hill-d2ab5e2039096407f86aeda2885fb9a1-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/ironside-hill-d2ab5e2039096407f86aeda2885fb9a1-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h2>Our verdict on Wanaka</h2>\\n<p>We liked the atmosphere of Wanaka, with the cute bars and restaurants without it being too much of a party town.
