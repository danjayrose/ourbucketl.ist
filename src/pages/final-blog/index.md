##Favourite Place
New Zealand. Hands down; there wasn't even any close competition. We thought North Island was stunning; the dolphins in Pahia, the rolling green hills where Lord of the Rings and Hobbiton were shot, the views from my skydive and our favourite kiwi city, windy Wellington. We didn't even get to Hot Water Beach or Tongariro National Park. Then we went to South Island and it was so beautiful, every bus journey consisted of us staring gormlessly out of the window looking at the coast, the mountains, the forests, farms and waterfalls. The animal encounters we had in New Zealand were also great, watching the penguins coming in from the beach, walking on the rocky coast to see the seals and seeing a Sperm Whale come up for air.

##Worst Food
The worst food we ate was on San Blas Islands but it didn't come as a surprise. As neither of us eat seafood the only food on offer was eggs and rice, cooked very badly. But luckily we only had to put up with it for a couple of days!

##Strangest Food
The strangest food we ate was Guinea Pig, a delicassy in Peru. It's very costly and usually eaten as a starter, so we had it tandoori style before our curry. It comes literally whacked in half, teeth included and tastes like the dark leg meat on a chicken.

##Lessons
Love hiking.

##Best Hostel
Not because it was the nicest, had a pool or good food but our favourite place to stay was Casa Mariposa in El Valle in Panama, purely because of their rescued sloths. The rooms themselves are the upstairs part of the owners houses and the rooms in the garden and we were lucky enough that the sloths needed their weekly toilet break whilst we were there so Harry brought them out into the garden where we were able to feed them flowers and take photos.

##Worst Hostel
Not because of the hostel but X in Rotorua was the worst, even more than the one we stayed in with bedbugs. This was due to the most loathesome roomate, Robert. Robert left his wet underpants and socks and clothes all over the shared room with the windows closed and the heating on high. Making the room smell like damp washing that been washed in a toilet.

##Of the Beaten Track
Nepalese Dinner.
