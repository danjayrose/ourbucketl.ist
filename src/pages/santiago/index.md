##Memory Museum
The tour guide from the free walking tour recommended the Memory museum to learn more about the genocide from the military dictatorship in Chile from ... to ... Although the museum was free, we were told at the entrance that it was all in Spanish but you could pay for an English audio guide. We decided against the audio guides as Sophie had read that you could still get a good understanding of the displays without them. We were pleased to find that the videos were subtitled in English and there were some translated displays dotted around.

The military dictatorship in Chile was something we both knew very little about and we were glad we spent some time to learn about this period in recent history. The museum was informative, moving and shocking across the diplays. There was a particular section that still haunts me, which was about the ways in which the soldiers tortured and interrogated the accused political prisoners. There was even a how to guide with diagrams showing how to perform various different torture methods which would have been distributed to the soldiers.
