However, after we’d decided the time wasn’t right to go to Bali/Lombok, Japan was the only place we both really wanted to go to instead. After finding return flights from Kuala Lumpur for £330 with <a href=\\\"https://www.airasia.com\\\">Air Asia</a>, which was an absolute bargin given that each flight was 7 hours, we went for it! Prior to going to Japan we also brought our <a href=\\\"http://www.japanrailpass.net/\\\">JR Passes</a> which can only be used by foreign tourists and have to be purchased from and sent to a foreign country. They work a little like the Inter-rail pass in Europe, we paid £300 for unlimited use of all the JR trains in Japan for two weeks, including some of the monorails, subways and ferries. If we’d decided on a more limited itinerary we could have got a limited and cheaper pass.</p>\\n<p>We arrived in Tokyo at 10:45PM and jumped on the monorail into the city from the airport. The city is absolutely massive, more like lots of little cities all joined together. In total, Tokyo is made up of 23 different city wards. We arrived at <a href=\\\"http://hostel-den.tokyo-hotels-stay.com/en/\\\">Hostel Den</a> in the Nihobashi district just after midnight and went straight to bed ready to explore Tokyo the next day.</p>\\n<h2>The busiest railway station in the world.</h2>\\n<p>The first area we went to was Shinjuku, which has the busiest railway station in the world and handles more than two million passengers every day. We booked our seats for our onward journeys at the JR office and had a wander around. The area is full of administrative buildings and tall skyscrapers, some of the tallest in the city, but we found there wasn’t much to see as a tourist during the day. However, we came back to Shinjuku at night to the Kabukicho area as it is known to be the red light district of Japan. The area was really lit up, especially ‘Godzilla Road’, which had a statue of Godzilla’s head on top of the building at the bottom of the street. We also found a statue of King Kong in some of the back streets. There were endless seedy clubs and ‘love hotels’ where rooms can be rented for a ‘rest’ or for the night. It was a side to Japan that was really unexpected!</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/godzilla-road-eed3e4b5b7ba539641ee02348f87c1a1-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Godzilla Road\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Godzilla Road\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/godzilla-road-eed3e4b5b7ba539641ee02348f87c1a1-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/godzilla-road-eed3e4b5b7ba539641ee02348f87c1a1-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/godzilla-road-eed3e4b5b7ba539641ee02348f87c1a1-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/godzilla-road-eed3e4b5b7ba539641ee02348f87c1a1-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>There was also a row of bars behind the station on Omide Yokocho Street, they’re all really tiny and only fit a few people in at a time, these kinds of bars are all over the city and apparently the street’s more popular name is ‘Piss Alley’.</p>\\n<h2>The most popular area in Tokyo.</h2>\\n<p>Shibuya was one stop on the JR Yamanote line, the busiest line in Tokyo, from Shinjuku. We headed there to see the infamous busy pedestrian crossing just outside of the Station. We weren’t even there during peak time but it was really busy and we headed to a bridge to view it from above; there were so many people crossing the roads when the lights changed they looked like tiny little ants. Unlike other big cities there weren’t that many cars on the road, everyone just seemed to make use of the trains. We also visited the Hachiko statue, Japan’s most famous dog. He is remembered for his loyalty to his owner, Hidesaburo Ueno, who he waited for for nine years after his death.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/dog-statue-7b107d0b8275f26bb6e6654102a95528-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 149.88888888888889%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Hachiko\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Hachiko\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/dog-statue-7b107d0b8275f26bb6e6654102a95528-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/dog-statue-7b107d0b8275f26bb6e6654102a95528-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/dog-statue-7b107d0b8275f26bb6e6654102a95528-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/dog-statue-7b107d0b8275f26bb6e6654102a95528-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>We also visited the <a href=\\\"https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3002.html\\\">Meji Shrine</a>, which is a peaceful place in the middle of the bustling city. The shrine is dedicated to Emperor Meji and Empress Shoken. It is located in a 70 hectre evergreen forest. Walking around made us feel like we were in the countryside, not in the middle of Tokyo. Sadly some of the shrine was being restored whilst we were there, but compared to other Shinto Shrines we visited during our time in Japan, it was empty and definitely worth the visit.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/meji-shrine-235c997d91fe000b75c2273c2e681984-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Meji Shrine\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Meji Shrine\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/meji-shrine-235c997d91fe000b75c2273c2e681984-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/meji-shrine-235c997d91fe000b75c2273c2e681984-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/meji-shrine-235c997d91fe000b75c2273c2e681984-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/meji-shrine-235c997d91fe000b75c2273c2e681984-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>We also did a little bit of shopping in Shibuya. Dan found a street called Cat Street that had some high street brands such as Patagonia, Champion and Adidas Originals. Samsung also had a shop advertising their new phone by having everyone in VR headsets on a stimulation ride which was funny to watch. It didn’t take long for me to feel uncomfortable in Japan in my backpacker clothes as Japanese women rarely had their knees or shoulders on show and almost everyone was in pastel and neutral coloured work wear. Japan was definitely not a place for my baggy elephant trousers.</p>\\n<h2>Tokyo’s Cafes.</h2>\\n<p>After Shinjuku our second stop in Tokyo was <a href=\\\"http://www.harinezumi-cafe.com/en/\\\">Harry Hedgehog Cafe</a>. There are a lot of weird and wonderful cafes in Tokyo to chose from including owls, cats, goats, lizards, dogs and even one with otters. Not to mention ‘cuddle cafes’, where guests can cuddle the staff, cosplay maid cafes and a crazy looking <a href=\\\"http://www.shinjuku-robot.com/pc/\\\">Robot Restaurant</a>. Knowing we couldn’t visit all of them, we picked two. We picked the hedgehog cafe first as it felt the least cruel. Hedgehogs are bred and sold as pets in Asia, like we have hamsters and chinchillas whereas owls being confined to a cafe and otters having a small bucket of water wasn’t something we would have felt comfortable seeing. We paid around 1300¥ (£8.70) for 30 minutes with the hedgehogs and 230¥ (£1.50) for some hedgehog treats. There were loads of hedgehogs in the cafe and we could see that they are rotated round so they weren’t handled all day. We got to pick them up with gloves on and saw some people next to us who had hedgehogs asleep in their hands. Ours were quite mischievous, they wanted the treats and ran over our hands like hamsters. When they got fed up we got a nip through the gloves to tell us to put them down. They were super cute, but my favourite was Bob, the biggest one they had. He was three years old and spent the entire thirty minutes curled up asleep with his face pushed against the glass.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/hedgehog-cafe-442e250557ef78e85ddaaac7db2c2f35-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Hedgehog Cafe\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Hedgehog Cafe\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/hedgehog-cafe-442e250557ef78e85ddaaac7db2c2f35-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/hedgehog-cafe-442e250557ef78e85ddaaac7db2c2f35-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/hedgehog-cafe-442e250557ef78e85ddaaac7db2c2f35-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/hedgehog-cafe-442e250557ef78e85ddaaac7db2c2f35-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>The second cafe we decided to visit was the <a href=\\\"https://www.govoyagin.com/activities/japan-tokyo-reservation-for-kawaii-monster-cafe-official-partner/4138\\\">Kawaii Monster Cafe</a>. As we walked in we felt like we’d walked into a children’s story, everything was so bright - colourful booths to sit in, milk bottles hanging from the ceiling and a stage like a merry-go-round in the middle of the floor. Like most things in Japan it was super cute, at first glance at least until we realised it was actually a little creepy. The milk bottles hanging from the ceiling were ‘feeding’ a couple of woodland animals and it didn’t take long for the entertainment to start. A woman in a pink bellydancer outfit took to the stage with a pink cat, they both started dancing to some very creepy music. All the food on the menu was brightly coloured, we chose some colourful and almost inedible Ramen. It cost 500¥ (£3.30) cover charge to enter and we had to order one drink and one food dish. Despite the fact that it was the worst and most expensive meal we had in Tokyo, Kawaii Monster Cafe was definitely worth the visit.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/monster-cafe-fb0f22d8512c98897f9eb91ffd7060a4-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBBAX/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAgP/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAc5yHMRWIKz/AP/EABkQAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMRIf/aAAgBAQABBQJR0lW4LhWzeH//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMf/aAAgBAwEBPwGn/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEC/9oACAECAQE/AcLX/8QAGBAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAAUWH/2gAIAQEABj8CljGV/8QAGhABAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARQTFhcf/aAAgBAQABPyF78hxsQu8fY+GLdRQWPY5P/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABC8H//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQEf/aAAgBAwEBPxAAaT//xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASER/9oACAECAQE/ELUZkz//xAAdEAEAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUFhUXGB/9oACAEBAAE/EFq1XJtPRKqbJF69LmY5C9zCT7DHowbz4gNr0cz/2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Kawaii Monster Cafe\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Monster Cafe\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/monster-cafe-fb0f22d8512c98897f9eb91ffd7060a4-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/monster-cafe-fb0f22d8512c98897f9eb91ffd7060a4-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/monster-cafe-fb0f22d8512c98897f9eb91ffd7060a4-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/monster-cafe-fb0f22d8512c98897f9eb91ffd7060a4-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h2>Harajuku</h2>\\n<p>Harajuku is known for being the area that youngster’s dressed like ‘Lolita’ hang around in, a bit like Birmingham’s pidgeon park.

There were also a couple of sweet shops that sold rainbow coloured candyfloss for 900¥ (around £6).</p>\\n<p>We did a bit of shopping on the street, there was a small alley full of souvenir shops, which were some of the cheapest in Japan, <a href=\\\"http://www.daisojapan.com/\\\">Daiso</a>, Japan’s equivalent to a Poundland, where we were able to pick up some souvenirs for under £1 and there were lots of small vintage shops. One of the bigger ones ‘Chicago’ was probably the best vintage shop we’ve ever been in. It wasn’t overly priced and everything was sorted into clothing type, colour and brand. There was even a second with vintage Disney jumpers. Tokyo is definitely a city that can be visited with an empty suitcase and a wallet full of cash!</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/takeshita-dori-5d4486179e3dee1a84200bafb2fc801d-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Takeshita Dori\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Takeshita Dori\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/takeshita-dori-5d4486179e3dee1a84200bafb2fc801d-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/takeshita-dori-5d4486179e3dee1a84200bafb2fc801d-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/takeshita-dori-5d4486179e3dee1a84200bafb2fc801d-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/takeshita-dori-5d4486179e3dee1a84200bafb2fc801d-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h2>Vintage Shops</h2>\\n<p>Harajuku wasn’t the only place full of vintage shops. We also visted two other area’s in the city that were full of them, Shimo-Kitazawa and Koenji. We headed to Shimo-Kitazawa first, an area with narrow streets with no footpaths full of boutique and vintage shops, some were cheaper than others. Annoyingly the second hand kimono shop we’d read about that sold them pretty cheap was closed but we did stumble across a store called <a href=\\\"https://tokyocheapo.com/shopping-2/village-vanguard-vintage-books-nerd/\\\">Vintage Vanguard</a>, technically a bookshop but it was also filled with Snoopy, Pokemon, Hello Kitty and Disney stuff.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/shimo-kitazawa-44fd729ed162e257d62d388db0017d78-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Shimo-Kitazawa\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Shimo-Kitazawa\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/shimo-kitazawa-44fd729ed162e257d62d388db0017d78-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/shimo-kitazawa-44fd729ed162e257d62d388db0017d78-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/shimo-kitazawa-44fd729ed162e257d62d388db0017d78-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/shimo-kitazawa-44fd729ed162e257d62d388db0017d78-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>On our return to Tokyo we headed to Koenji, which was more relaxed than Shimo-Kitazawa and some of the shops were a little more like the equivalent of a charity shop more than a vintage store. There was a long street full of them and we thoroughly regretted that we weren’t able to stuff anything else in our backpacks.</p>\\n<h2>Senso-ji Temple</h2>\\n<p>We spent one morning in Asakusa, which is an area famous for Tokyo’s oldest temple Senso-ji Temple, built in 645AD. To reach the temple we had to walk down Nakamise, a long shopping street now full of souvenir shops, but its supposed to have a history of several centuries.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/senso-ji-7e3eb33c795e3ed4d1883d6ca16c100d-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 117.66666666666667%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAYABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQABAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQBAgMF/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAaUWYteerlsEgl//xAAeEAABAwQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhAgMEFBITIv/aAAgBAQABBQIZLrZnYQLgQnnlW10+Owhf/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAwEBPwEf/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAgEBPwEf/8QAHhAAAgEDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERECFRAhIyYZH/2gAIAQEABj8CsmRtZxdMIvHhZqOzSs0//8QAHBABAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIVEQQaHw/9oACAEBAAE/IQpblcmkmWYIa0bxO70i1KvcIu0NJUB+HB//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEN/vPv/EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARASH/2gAIAQMBAT8QmJi9V//EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABERD/2gAIAQIBAT8QrK9//8QAHhABAQACAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAREAIUFhMVGRcfD/2gAIAQEAAT8Q8sXk8fcIwFaWjgDEP24K4S1IHrvAEQJQSlJ1u/3vKK/Z5YlhU0Ccfcgjsk60ciBQXaJn/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Nakamise\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Nakamise\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/senso-ji-7e3eb33c795e3ed4d1883d6ca16c100d-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/senso-ji-7e3eb33c795e3ed4d1883d6ca16c100d-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/senso-ji-7e3eb33c795e3ed4d1883d6ca16c100d-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/senso-ji-7e3eb33c795e3ed4d1883d6ca16c100d-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Senso-ji was absolutely heaving with tourists and a lot of people were dressed in kimono’s, which can be rented for the day.

Second hand seller prices were absolutely insane, some were going for £500, so our options were to either head to the stadium in the early hours of the morning to get same day tickets or our hostel was able to call ahead to one of the sumo houses to ask if we could watch them practice. We asked our hostel to do the latter but they said that because of the tournament we weren’t able to watch them.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/sumo-b9db518e017650d25db788d421c83ec9-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 67.11111111111111%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Sumo\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Sumo\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/sumo-b9db518e017650d25db788d421c83ec9-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/sumo-b9db518e017650d25db788d421c83ec9-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/sumo-b9db518e017650d25db788d421c83ec9-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/sumo-b9db518e017650d25db788d421c83ec9-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>We headed to Rygoken anyway as we went to visit the <a href=\\\"https://www.edo-tokyo-museum.or.jp/en/\\\">Edo Museum</a> and at least see the stadium. On our walk to the stadium we saw plenty of sumo walking around in their yakata getting breakfast and completing their daily errands. One sumo came out of a restaurant and loads of people were queuing up and asking for a photo with him, so we did the same! It turned out that he had retired that day and he was the heaviest sumo wrestler to date! His name is Orora and he originally comes from Russia.</p>\\n<h2>The Edo Period.</h2>\\n<p>We ended up spending hours at the Edo Museum, it was huge and there was lots to read and look at. The museum gives a very detailed history from the Edo Period in Japan, through the Meji Period and into modern day Japan. It was very interactive and a great museum for kids so unsurprisingly it was full of school trips. It cost us 600¥ to visit (just £4).</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/edo-museum-a130f040908a9247c2292fa348053520-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 52.11111111111111%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Edo Museum\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Edo Museum\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/edo-museum-a130f040908a9247c2292fa348053520-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/edo-museum-a130f040908a9247c2292fa348053520-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/edo-museum-a130f040908a9247c2292fa348053520-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/edo-museum-a130f040908a9247c2292fa348053520-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Starving after spending so long in the museum we headed to a local ramen bar. Japan is so clean we figured we didn’t really need to worry about hygiene and where to eat so headed to where the locals gathered. Like most bars and restaurants in Japan there was a kitchen in the middle with a bar to sit round and eat at. We had to order our food at a vending machine and give the tickets to the chefs!</p>\\n<h2>Geek Heaven.</h2>\\n<p>We’d read about a place in a Tokyo that was tech heaven, where we could look through Manga shops, hit the arcades and even buy retro video games and consoles. Akihabara did not disappoint. As soon as we got off the train and came up to the street, there were huge lit up signs, like in Shinjuku. There was a massive Sega shop and we had a look in Yodobashi which was 7 stories high, full of everything you could even think of. We had a look in some of the smaller stores and found retro games including game gear and sega megadrive.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/akihabara-d2e33bd632bcf9c2c2c424ab0a87a8bb-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 124.33333333333334%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAZABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQBAwUC/8QAFwEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDAf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABzGk7FoqaA0qyIynQAv8A/8QAGhAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxESMf/aAAgBAQABBQKgAs9S5hlQ09EBbKlCHJYxcDnF8aDz/8QAFhEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASAx/9oACAEDAQE/ARE//8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASD/2gAIAQIBAT8BY//EAB4QAAICAAcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABECECESAxMnGB/9oACAEBAAY/AsmVD6jjiG1uW0Kl7o//xAAfEAADAAEDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhEDFBUWFxscH/2gAIAQEAAT8hd0qS5G7xfs7Q+Dii9GRDZ0FO9GkqY/ZXhnLbSzDPhp2D/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABB40Qz/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEx/9oACAEDAQE/ECdE7bPb/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERIf/aAAgBAgEBPxBncEJZRSH/xAAgEAEAAgIBBAMAAAAAAAAAAAABESEAQWExcYGRocHw/9oACAEBAAE/EFbJJKq6d8fkmaZKc36XNgr4xBlPSXvjJBAAkQmt5YFQ2KIPsce0hKlfGICgVRMHbEjQEUmY4z8vObec+Nn/2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Akihabara\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Akihabara\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/akihabara-d2e33bd632bcf9c2c2c424ab0a87a8bb-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/akihabara-d2e33bd632bcf9c2c2c424ab0a87a8bb-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/akihabara-d2e33bd632bcf9c2c2c424ab0a87a8bb-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/akihabara-d2e33bd632bcf9c2c2c424ab0a87a8bb-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>All along the streets were shops filled with vending machines.

We also had a go on the Grab Machines, we got a bit hooked trying to win a Pikachu but sadly we couldn’t grab it and didn’t want to waste too much money.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/vending-machines-3235a8134e23449762b7024a7ec66298-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Vending Machines\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Vending Machines\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/vending-machines-3235a8134e23449762b7024a7ec66298-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/vending-machines-3235a8134e23449762b7024a7ec66298-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/vending-machines-3235a8134e23449762b7024a7ec66298-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/vending-machines-3235a8134e23449762b7024a7ec66298-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>We’d heard about maid cafes in the area, another of Tokyo’s crazy cafes. People go there to be waited on and treated like a ‘master’, the girls also like to have conversations with you whilst you enjoy whatever you order. All along the main and backstreets in Akihabara were girls dressed in ‘cosplay’ maid outfits trying to get people to go into their cafes. It was bizarre and felt very seedy, so we decided to give it a miss!</p>\\n<h2>Baseball.</h2>\\n<p>After a couple of days in Tokyo when we first arrived in Japan, we decided we loved it so much that we wanted to stay longer and changed our train on the way back to give us more time there. Unfortunately typhoon Trami hit so we ended up only gaining an extra afternoon. We’d heard that baseball is Japan’s favourite sport but it wasn’t until we got to Hiroshima and saw the carps advertised everywhere that we realised how big it was! We tried to catch a game in Hiroshima but tickets were sold out so thought we’d try our luck in Tokyo to see the Yakult Swallows and Yomiuri Giants. Our train was due in at 15:40 and the game started at 18:00. Worried it would be sold out too we booked tickets on Viagogo, they cost £17 each so we knew we probably could have got them half the price if we’d got them from the stadium or a seven eleven.</p>\\n<p>We thought the game would probably be all in Japanese but there was an american announcer and it turned out to be as much fun as a basketball game in America! We sat in the ‘free seat’ area with the hardcore fans who sang the entire time the Swallows were batting. Luckily the game was an exciting 8-5 and the songs and chanting kept us entertained.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/baseball-eaa2f2fd9c95f212b129f2199f5d2417-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 102.22222222222221%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Baseball\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Baseball\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/baseball-eaa2f2fd9c95f212b129f2199f5d2417-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/baseball-eaa2f2fd9c95f212b129f2199f5d2417-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/baseball-eaa2f2fd9c95f212b129f2199f5d2417-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/baseball-eaa2f2fd9c95f212b129f2199f5d2417-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>The fans had a band who spurred them along and fans had a chant for each player.

However, after we’d decided the time wasn’t right to go to Bali/Lombok, Japan was the only place we both really wanted to go to instead. After finding return flights from Kuala Lumpur for £330 with <a href=\\\"https://www.airasia.com\\\">Air Asia</a>, which was an absolute bargin given that each flight was 7 hours, we went for it! Prior to going to Japan we also brought our <a href=\\\"http://www.japanrailpass.net/\\\">JR Passes</a> which can only be used by foreign tourists and have to be purchased from and sent to a foreign country. They work a little like the Inter-rail pass in Europe, we paid £300 for unlimited use of all the JR trains in Japan for two weeks, including some of the monorails, subways and ferries. If we’d decided on a more limited itinerary we could have got a limited and cheaper pass.</p>\\n<p>We arrived in Tokyo at 10:45PM and jumped on the monorail into the city from the airport. The city is absolutely massive, more like lots of little cities all joined together. In total, Tokyo is made up of 23 different city wards. We arrived at <a href=\\\"http://hostel-den.tokyo-hotels-stay.com/en/\\\">Hostel Den</a> in the Nihobashi district just after midnight and went straight to bed ready to explore Tokyo the next day.</p>\\n<h2>The busiest railway station in the world.</h2>\\n<p>The first area we went to was Shinjuku, which has the busiest railway station in the world and handles more than two million passengers every day. We booked our seats for our onward journeys at the JR office and had a wander around. The area is full of administrative buildings and tall skyscrapers, some of the tallest in the city, but we found there wasn’t much to see as a tourist during the day. However, we came back to Shinjuku at night to the Kabukicho area as it is known to be the red light district of Japan. The area was really lit up, especially ‘Godzilla Road’, which had a statue of Godzilla’s head on top of the building at the bottom of the street. We also found a statue of King Kong in some of the back streets. There were endless seedy clubs and ‘love hotels’ where rooms can be rented for a ‘rest’ or for the night. It was a side to Japan that was really unexpected!</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/godzilla-road-eed3e4b5b7ba539641ee02348f87c1a1-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Godzilla Road\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Godzilla Road\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/godzilla-road-eed3e4b5b7ba539641ee02348f87c1a1-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/godzilla-road-eed3e4b5b7ba539641ee02348f87c1a1-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/godzilla-road-eed3e4b5b7ba539641ee02348f87c1a1-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/godzilla-road-eed3e4b5b7ba539641ee02348f87c1a1-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>There was also a row of bars behind the station on Omide Yokocho Street, they’re all really tiny and only fit a few people in at a time, these kinds of bars are all over the city and apparently the street’s more popular name is ‘Piss Alley’.</p>\\n<h2>The most popular area in Tokyo.</h2>\\n<p>Shibuya was one stop on the JR Yamanote line, the busiest line in Tokyo, from Shinjuku. We headed there to see the infamous busy pedestrian crossing just outside of the Station. We weren’t even there during peak time but it was really busy and we headed to a bridge to view it from above; there were so many people crossing the roads when the lights changed they looked like tiny little ants. Unlike other big cities there weren’t that many cars on the road, everyone just seemed to make use of the trains. We also visited the Hachiko statue, Japan’s most famous dog. He is remembered for his loyalty to his owner, Hidesaburo Ueno, who he waited for for nine years after his death.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/dog-statue-7b107d0b8275f26bb6e6654102a95528-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 149.88888888888889%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Hachiko\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Hachiko\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/dog-statue-7b107d0b8275f26bb6e6654102a95528-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/dog-statue-7b107d0b8275f26bb6e6654102a95528-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/dog-statue-7b107d0b8275f26bb6e6654102a95528-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/dog-statue-7b107d0b8275f26bb6e6654102a95528-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>We also visited the <a href=\\\"https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3002.html\\\">Meji Shrine</a>, which is a peaceful place in the middle of the bustling city.

Dan found a street called Cat Street that had some high street brands such as Patagonia, Champion and Adidas Originals. Samsung also had a shop advertising their new phone by having everyone in VR headsets on a stimulation ride which was funny to watch. It didn’t take long for me to feel uncomfortable in Japan in my backpacker clothes as Japanese women rarely had their knees or shoulders on show and almost everyone was in pastel and neutral coloured work wear. Japan was definitely not a place for my baggy elephant trousers.</p>\\n<h2>Tokyo’s Cafes.</h2>\\n<p>After Shinjuku our second stop in Tokyo was <a href=\\\"http://www.harinezumi-cafe.com/en/\\\">Harry Hedgehog Cafe</a>. There are a lot of weird and wonderful cafes in Tokyo to chose from including owls, cats, goats, lizards, dogs and even one with otters. Not to mention ‘cuddle cafes’, where guests can cuddle the staff, cosplay maid cafes and a crazy looking <a href=\\\"http://www.shinjuku-robot.com/pc/\\\">Robot Restaurant</a>. Knowing we couldn’t visit all of them, we picked two. We picked the hedgehog cafe first as it felt the least cruel. Hedgehogs are bred and sold as pets in Asia, like we have hamsters and chinchillas whereas owls being confined to a cafe and otters having a small bucket of water wasn’t something we would have felt comfortable seeing. We paid around 1300¥ (£8.70) for 30 minutes with the hedgehogs and 230¥ (£1.50) for some hedgehog treats. There were loads of hedgehogs in the cafe and we could see that they are rotated round so they weren’t handled all day. We got to pick them up with gloves on and saw some people next to us who had hedgehogs asleep in their hands. Ours were quite mischievous, they wanted the treats and ran over our hands like hamsters. When they got fed up we got a nip through the gloves to tell us to put them down. They were super cute, but my favourite was Bob, the biggest one they had. He was three years old and spent the entire thirty minutes curled up asleep with his face pushed against the glass.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/hedgehog-cafe-442e250557ef78e85ddaaac7db2c2f35-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Hedgehog Cafe\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Hedgehog Cafe\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/hedgehog-cafe-442e250557ef78e85ddaaac7db2c2f35-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/hedgehog-cafe-442e250557ef78e85ddaaac7db2c2f35-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/hedgehog-cafe-442e250557ef78e85ddaaac7db2c2f35-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/hedgehog-cafe-442e250557ef78e85ddaaac7db2c2f35-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>The second cafe we decided to visit was the <a href=\\\"https://www.govoyagin.com/activities/japan-tokyo-reservation-for-kawaii-monster-cafe-official-partner/4138\\\">Kawaii Monster Cafe</a>. As we walked in we felt like we’d walked into a children’s story, everything was so bright - colourful booths to sit in, milk bottles hanging from the ceiling and a stage like a merry-go-round in the middle of the floor. Like most things in Japan it was super cute, at first glance at least until we realised it was actually a little creepy. The milk bottles hanging from the ceiling were ‘feeding’ a couple of woodland animals and it didn’t take long for the entertainment to start. A woman in a pink bellydancer outfit took to the stage with a pink cat, they both started dancing to some very creepy music. All the food on the menu was brightly coloured, we chose some colourful and almost inedible Ramen. It cost 500¥ (£3.30) cover charge to enter and we had to order one drink and one food dish. Despite the fact that it was the worst and most expensive meal we had in Tokyo, Kawaii Monster Cafe was definitely worth the visit.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/monster-cafe-fb0f22d8512c98897f9eb91ffd7060a4-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Kawaii Monster Cafe\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Monster Cafe\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/monster-cafe-fb0f22d8512c98897f9eb91ffd7060a4-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/monster-cafe-fb0f22d8512c98897f9eb91ffd7060a4-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/monster-cafe-fb0f22d8512c98897f9eb91ffd7060a4-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/monster-cafe-fb0f22d8512c98897f9eb91ffd7060a4-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h2>Harajuku</h2>\\n<p>Harajuku is known for being the area that youngster’s dressed like ‘Lolita’ hang around in, a bit like Birmingham’s pidgeon park.

There were also a couple of sweet shops that sold rainbow coloured candyfloss for 900¥ (around £6).</p>\\n<p>We did a bit of shopping on the street, there was a small alley full of souvenir shops, which were some of the cheapest in Japan, <a href=\\\"http://www.daisojapan.com/\\\">Daiso</a>, Japan’s equivalent to a Poundland, where we were able to pick up some souvenirs for under £1 and there were lots of small vintage shops. One of the bigger ones ‘Chicago’ was probably the best vintage shop we’ve ever been in. It wasn’t overly priced and everything was sorted into clothing type, colour and brand. There was even a second with vintage Disney jumpers. Tokyo is definitely a city that can be visited with an empty suitcase and a wallet full of cash!</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/takeshita-dori-5d4486179e3dee1a84200bafb2fc801d-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Takeshita Dori\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Takeshita Dori\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/takeshita-dori-5d4486179e3dee1a84200bafb2fc801d-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/takeshita-dori-5d4486179e3dee1a84200bafb2fc801d-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/takeshita-dori-5d4486179e3dee1a84200bafb2fc801d-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/takeshita-dori-5d4486179e3dee1a84200bafb2fc801d-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h2>Vintage Shops</h2>\\n<p>Harajuku wasn’t the only place full of vintage shops.

There was a long street full of them and we thoroughly regretted that we weren’t able to stuff anything else in our backpacks.</p>\\n<h2>Senso-ji Temple</h2>\\n<p>We spent one morning in Asakusa, which is an area famous for Tokyo’s oldest temple Senso-ji Temple, built in 645AD. To reach the temple we had to walk down Nakamise, a long shopping street now full of souvenir shops, but its supposed to have a history of several centuries.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/senso-ji-7e3eb33c795e3ed4d1883d6ca16c100d-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 117.66666666666667%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Nakamise\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Nakamise\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/senso-ji-7e3eb33c795e3ed4d1883d6ca16c100d-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/senso-ji-7e3eb33c795e3ed4d1883d6ca16c100d-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/senso-ji-7e3eb33c795e3ed4d1883d6ca16c100d-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/senso-ji-7e3eb33c795e3ed4d1883d6ca16c100d-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Senso-ji was absolutely heaving with tourists and a lot of people were dressed in kimono’s, which can be rented for the day. After we’d snapped a few photo’s and resisted buying anything from the shops we tried matcha ice cream, made from Japanese green tea, it was much nicer than the bitter cold green tea drinks that can be found everywhere in Japan.

We could see Senso-ji Temple and Nakamise, the Asahi Headquarters which is a building shaped like a mug of beer and the ‘golden turd’ or ‘Asahi Flame’.</p>\\n<h2>Sumo</h2>\\n<p>It turned out that we were fortunate enough to be in Tokyo for a sumo tournament, but we unfortunately couldn’t get tickets as all the seats had sold out. Second hand seller prices were absolutely insane, some were going for £500, so our options were to either head to the stadium in the early hours of the morning to get same day tickets or our hostel was able to call ahead to one of the sumo houses to ask if we could watch them practice. We asked our hostel to do the latter but they said that because of the tournament we weren’t able to watch them.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/sumo-b9db518e017650d25db788d421c83ec9-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 67.11111111111111%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Sumo\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Sumo\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/sumo-b9db518e017650d25db788d421c83ec9-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/sumo-b9db518e017650d25db788d421c83ec9-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/sumo-b9db518e017650d25db788d421c83ec9-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/sumo-b9db518e017650d25db788d421c83ec9-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>We headed to Rygoken anyway as we went to visit the <a href=\\\"https://www.edo-tokyo-museum.or.jp/en/\\\">Edo Museum</a> and at least see the stadium. On our walk to the stadium we saw plenty of sumo walking around in their yakata getting breakfast and completing their daily errands. One sumo came out of a restaurant and loads of people were queuing up and asking for a photo with him, so we did the same! It turned out that he had retired that day and he was the heaviest sumo wrestler to date! His name is Orora and he originally comes from Russia.</p>\\n<h2>The Edo Period.</h2>\\n<p>We ended up spending hours at the Edo Museum, it was huge and there was lots to read and look at. The museum gives a very detailed history from the Edo Period in Japan, through the Meji Period and into modern day Japan. It was very interactive and a great museum for kids so unsurprisingly it was full of school trips. It cost us 600¥ to visit (just £4).</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/edo-museum-a130f040908a9247c2292fa348053520-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 52.11111111111111%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Edo Museum\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Edo Museum\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/edo-museum-a130f040908a9247c2292fa348053520-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/edo-museum-a130f040908a9247c2292fa348053520-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/edo-museum-a130f040908a9247c2292fa348053520-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/edo-museum-a130f040908a9247c2292fa348053520-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>Starving after spending so long in the museum we headed to a local ramen bar. Japan is so clean we figured we didn’t really need to worry about hygiene and where to eat so headed to where the locals gathered. Like most bars and restaurants in Japan there was a kitchen in the middle with a bar to sit round and eat at. We had to order our food at a vending machine and give the tickets to the chefs!</p>\\n<h2>Geek Heaven.</h2>\\n<p>We’d read about a place in a Tokyo that was tech heaven, where we could look through Manga shops, hit the arcades and even buy retro video games and consoles. Akihabara did not disappoint. As soon as we got off the train and came up to the street, there were huge lit up signs, like in Shinjuku. There was a massive Sega shop and we had a look in Yodobashi which was 7 stories high, full of everything you could even think of. We had a look in some of the smaller stores and found retro games including game gear and sega megadrive.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/akihabara-d2e33bd632bcf9c2c2c424ab0a87a8bb-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 124.33333333333334%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Akihabara\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Akihabara\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/akihabara-d2e33bd632bcf9c2c2c424ab0a87a8bb-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/akihabara-d2e33bd632bcf9c2c2c424ab0a87a8bb-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/akihabara-d2e33bd632bcf9c2c2c424ab0a87a8bb-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/akihabara-d2e33bd632bcf9c2c2c424ab0a87a8bb-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>All along the streets were shops filled with vending machines.

We also had a go on the Grab Machines, we got a bit hooked trying to win a Pikachu but sadly we couldn’t grab it and didn’t want to waste too much money.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/vending-machines-3235a8134e23449762b7024a7ec66298-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Vending Machines\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Vending Machines\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/vending-machines-3235a8134e23449762b7024a7ec66298-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/vending-machines-3235a8134e23449762b7024a7ec66298-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/vending-machines-3235a8134e23449762b7024a7ec66298-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/vending-machines-3235a8134e23449762b7024a7ec66298-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>We’d heard about maid cafes in the area, another of Tokyo’s crazy cafes. People go there to be waited on and treated like a ‘master’, the girls also like to have conversations with you whilst you enjoy whatever you order. All along the main and backstreets in Akihabara were girls dressed in ‘cosplay’ maid outfits trying to get people to go into their cafes. It was bizarre and felt very seedy, so we decided to give it a miss!</p>\\n<h2>Baseball.</h2>\\n<p>After a couple of days in Tokyo when we first arrived in Japan, we decided we loved it so much that we wanted to stay longer and changed our train on the way back to give us more time there. Unfortunately typhoon Trami hit so we ended up only gaining an extra afternoon. We’d heard that baseball is Japan’s favourite sport but it wasn’t until we got to Hiroshima and saw the carps advertised everywhere that we realised how big it was! We tried to catch a game in Hiroshima but tickets were sold out so thought we’d try our luck in Tokyo to see the Yakult Swallows and Yomiuri Giants. Our train was due in at 15:40 and the game started at 18:00. Worried it would be sold out too we booked tickets on Viagogo, they cost £17 each so we knew we probably could have got them half the price if we’d got them from the stadium or a seven eleven.</p>\\n<p>We thought the game would probably be all in Japanese but there was an american announcer and it turned out to be as much fun as a basketball game in America! We sat in the ‘free seat’ area with the hardcore fans who sang the entire time the Swallows were batting. Luckily the game was an exciting 8-5 and the songs and chanting kept us entertained.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/baseball-eaa2f2fd9c95f212b129f2199f5d2417-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 102.22222222222221%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Baseball\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Baseball\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/baseball-eaa2f2fd9c95f212b129f2199f5d2417-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/baseball-eaa2f2fd9c95f212b129f2199f5d2417-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/baseball-eaa2f2fd9c95f212b129f2199f5d2417-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/baseball-eaa2f2fd9c95f212b129f2199f5d2417-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>The fans had a band who spurred them along and fans had a chant for each player.

The people around us were so friendly that they let us borrow their spare umberellas so that we could join in! There was also a KFC in the stadium and ‘ghostbusters’ (girls with beer) so we didn’t starve or go thirsty during the game either!</p>\\n<h2>Our verdict on Tokyo</h2>\\n<p>Tokyo was easily one of our favourite cities we’ve ever visited.
