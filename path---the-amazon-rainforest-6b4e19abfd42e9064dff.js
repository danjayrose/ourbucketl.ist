It was the most we had been harassed since arriving in South America, including on Copcabana Beach! We managed to find an offical taxi driver who weaved in and out of the traffic to <a href="http://www.hospedajeneydita.com/">Hostel Neydita</a> where we were staying. The traffic was crazy; there were families of four balanced on one motorcycle, women breastfeeding their children on motorcycles and people sat in plastic chairs in the trailers attached to the motorcycles. We later learned that as Iquitos is only accessible by air or by a very long boat journey, there is a Honda motorcycle factory in the city where people can buy one for less than S./3000 (£672).</p>\n<h2>Belen Market</h2>\n<p>We were picked up in the morning by our guide, Osmar from <a href="http://www.iquitos-tour.com/en/jungle-tours-Libertad">Libertad Lodge</a> where we would be staying in the Amazon for four days. We picked the lodge as it seemed to be good value for money; we could make our own itinerary, the money went towards helping the local community and there wasn’t a single bad review on Tripadvisor out of hundreds. It cost us $350 each (around £280) for three nights and four days all inclusive. We broke up the three hour journey there by firstly visiting <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/peru/iquitos/attractions/belen/a/poi-sig/1277432/363385">Belen Market</a>. We had read that it was one of South America’s most bizarre markets, with all sorts of strange things for sale in ‘Shaman’s Alley’, such as monkeys hands, bird beaks, snake skins and ayahuasca by the bottle. Ayahuasca is a plant that has hallucagenic properties said to heal all sorts of problems when used by a Shaman; lots of tourists come to Peru to experience ayahuasca ceremonies.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/belen-market-d77fe1a5d49abdd761d275ecfd15d8b3-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Belen Market"\n        title="Belen Market"\n        src="/static/belen-market-d77fe1a5d49abdd761d275ecfd15d8b3-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/belen-market-d77fe1a5d49abdd761d275ecfd15d8b3-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/belen-market-d77fe1a5d49abdd761d275ecfd15d8b3-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/belen-market-d77fe1a5d49abdd761d275ecfd15d8b3-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Osmar showed us around and pointed out all the tropical fruits and vegetables. He then took us around the part where people were selling meat; the weirdest thing we saw was a turtle without its shell, which people apparently eat. After getting to know Osmar a little better and how much he loves animals, we knew this was the reason why he didn’t take us to see anything really strange and in the end we were grateful.</p>\n<h2>The Dallas World Aquarium; Amazon Rescue Centre</h2>\n<p><a href="https://www.dwazoo.com/conservations/peru/centro-de-rescate-amazonico-amazon-rescue-center/">The Amazon Rescue Centre</a> started up ten years ago for rescued manatee’s and is now funded by Dallas University. For S/.20 (£5) each a guide showed us around and introduced us to all of the rescued animals they have there. He explained that the animals they have in CREA are rescued from local people who had them as pets. He explained that they are rehabilitated and then put back into the wild when they are deemed ready by biologists. We saw a two month old ocelot, a type of big cat, she was very cute and playful. Its owners had given her up when she started to bite. There were also two scartlett macaws there who had been mistreated, they guarded all of the rescued turtles. The guide demonstrated this by entering the pen and trying to pick up the turtles, the macaws chased him threatening to bite until he left the turtles alone.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/macaws-41bdcf4f133522ce1ce80fc4eddab444-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Macaws"\n        title="Macaws"\n        src="/static/macaws-41bdcf4f133522ce1ce80fc4eddab444-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/macaws-41bdcf4f133522ce1ce80fc4eddab444-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/macaws-41bdcf4f133522ce1ce80fc4eddab444-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/macaws-41bdcf4f133522ce1ce80fc4eddab444-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>There were also rescued otters, my favourite animal!

Sadly, the guide told us that once monkeys had become domesticated and dependent on humans, because of how smart they are, they are not able to rehabilitate them back to the wild completely. The guide explained that they go to places such as <a href="https://laisladelosmonos.org/">Monkey Island</a> where they are able to live in the rainforest, but tourists visit and give them food. Lastly we saw the manatee’s; there were three. The guide told us there are more but they are closer to being released so are in the rehabilitation centre. He explained that rehabilitation takes three years in total for each manatee and in ten years they have successfully rehabilitated around twenty. There was one manatee isolated in his own pool, the guide said that he had been found with a plastic bag in his stomach which he had swallowed due to it being in all the vegetation.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/manatee-9f9980d1d05d4eef5dd3b504a08750ba-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Manatees"\n        title="Manatees"\n        src="/static/manatee-9f9980d1d05d4eef5dd3b504a08750ba-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/manatee-9f9980d1d05d4eef5dd3b504a08750ba-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/manatee-9f9980d1d05d4eef5dd3b504a08750ba-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/manatee-9f9980d1d05d4eef5dd3b504a08750ba-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>The guide told us that although they are a rescue centre, their main purpose is to educate the local children. He said when children come to visit they talk about the exotic pets they have at home at the beginning of their visit, but by the end they know that it is wrong and that the animals should be free. He said many of the children actually come back with their parents to donate their pets to the centre. The guide explained that the older generation are stuck in their ways and will continue to hunt manatee and kill turtles for meat, but that they hope educating the younger generation will help make a difference to the animals of the rainforest.</p>\n<h2>Libertad Lodge</h2>\n<p>After a two hour drive and an hour and a half on a motorboat, we finally reached Libertad Village. The lodge was on stilts due to the flooding during rainy season, however we were visiting just at the end, so although it was muddy we could walk on the land around the lodge. We had a cute bungalow with a bathroom and most importantly a mosquito net!

There were two types, pink  which were shyer, had a longer snout and a rounder dorsel fin, and grey tucuxi dolphins which were more playful and easier to spot. We sat with the motor off for a long time watching the pink sunset turn the murky water lilac, with the dolphins popping up out of the water all around us. At one point, Manuel one of our drivers, did donuts in the water in the boat to disturb the fish and get the dolphins closer to us. There were parts of the water we could swim in but the water was so murky and knowing that there were piranha, water snakes and stingrays in there, neither of us were brave enough to take a dunk.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/dolphins-ad5a0ef96f3f1f77230a2b579776d1a5-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Dolphins at sunset"\n        title="Dolphins at sunset"\n        src="/static/dolphins-ad5a0ef96f3f1f77230a2b579776d1a5-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/dolphins-ad5a0ef96f3f1f77230a2b579776d1a5-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/dolphins-ad5a0ef96f3f1f77230a2b579776d1a5-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/dolphins-ad5a0ef96f3f1f77230a2b579776d1a5-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Tarantulas</h2>\n<p>We had expected to go hunting for tarantula and got ready in our wellies, long sleeves and headtorches for a night hike, but it turned out there were lots of tarantula on the other side of the village.

We got a few pictures and our guide asked if we wanted to hold one, he told us that they bite and can be venomous but mostly to paralyse their prey such as insects and that their hairs are just irritating to human skin.

Firstly, Manuel our driver had to navigate through a creek, because the creeks were drying out, there were lots of logs and tree roots to navigate through. At one point the boat got stuck on a tree stump and I thought it was going to tip over; both guides had to get out in their wellies to dislodge it.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/creek-cc1efbb029ffda6b739d4fae24b5ee48-4b1f0.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 897px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Creek"\n        title="Creek"\n        src="/static/creek-cc1efbb029ffda6b739d4fae24b5ee48-4b1f0.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/creek-cc1efbb029ffda6b739d4fae24b5ee48-a5625.jpg 225w,\n/static/creek-cc1efbb029ffda6b739d4fae24b5ee48-39b55.jpg 450w,\n/static/creek-cc1efbb029ffda6b739d4fae24b5ee48-4b1f0.jpg 897w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 897px) 100vw, 897px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>The land was muddy and in parts flooded.

Whilst we were walking, Osmar had a bullet ant on his boot and Manuel managed to get it off with his machete before he was bitten. The guide explained that bullet ant bites are supposed to be really painful for 24 hours. Osmar also showed us a fruit with a grub inside and said we could eat it. When we both said we were full he ate it and said it tasted like coconut. He also collected some mocambo fruits which he said we could try on the way back and he would roast the nuts on the inside for us with our dinner.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/bullet-ant-b5d1df4ed431d532dccf4cbfce93ccb5-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Bullet ant"\n        title="Bullet ant"\n        src="/static/bullet-ant-b5d1df4ed431d532dccf4cbfce93ccb5-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/bullet-ant-b5d1df4ed431d532dccf4cbfce93ccb5-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/bullet-ant-b5d1df4ed431d532dccf4cbfce93ccb5-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/bullet-ant-b5d1df4ed431d532dccf4cbfce93ccb5-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Monkeys</h2>\n<p>On the way back, the guide opened some of the mocambo fruits for us to try.

He said that although they could collect their own fruits and nuts, whenever they heard an engine, they knew it was the sound of humans which meant food and they would come down to investigate.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/common-woolly-monkey-af64deace64dd1b5ad200ab2238f1e9b-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Common woolly monkeys"\n        title="Common woolly monkeys"\n        src="/static/common-woolly-monkey-af64deace64dd1b5ad200ab2238f1e9b-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/common-woolly-monkey-af64deace64dd1b5ad200ab2238f1e9b-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/common-woolly-monkey-af64deace64dd1b5ad200ab2238f1e9b-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/common-woolly-monkey-af64deace64dd1b5ad200ab2238f1e9b-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>They absolutely loved scooping the flesh out of the mocambo fruit and when they had finished they cuddled up together on the guides lap before coming over and doing the same on ours.

We watched one licking the tree sap. We also saw some owl monkeys, they’re nocturnal so the guide had to hit the tree with a vine to get them to come out and see what was going on. The monkey’s were  either small, so quick or so high up in the tree tops it made it almost impossible to get a good photo unless we had invested in an expensive lens as long as our arms.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/pygmy-marmoset-913cf2de08f3f7d0920bfb677fe9804d-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Pygmy marmoset"\n        title="Pygmy marmoset"\n        src="/static/pygmy-marmoset-913cf2de08f3f7d0920bfb677fe9804d-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/pygmy-marmoset-913cf2de08f3f7d0920bfb677fe9804d-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/pygmy-marmoset-913cf2de08f3f7d0920bfb677fe9804d-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/pygmy-marmoset-913cf2de08f3f7d0920bfb677fe9804d-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Searching for caiman</h2>\n<p>We were nervous about looking for caiman at night, especially in the lodges tiny boats and because Osmar had said we’d try and catch one. Manuel drove the boat through a small creek and after a while we hit a lot of vegetation, mostly lillipads and water lettuce. This also meant lots of insects, there were thousands of them. Because of the light from our headtorches there were mosquitos and flies in our faces and grasshoppers, spiders, crickets and frogs were all jumping in the boat. The thick vegetation was building up at the front of the boat preventing us from going anywhere and we knew there were caiman in the water. After the ordeal was over, we asked the guide about the big spider’s we’d seen, he said they were wandering spiders but the aquatic kind not the deadly ones to humans. He told us they often find water snakes in the vegetation too which get lifted up towards the boat, luckily this hadn’t happened to us.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/caiman-2ce44e0928c38c4ce5fc2f88157b1f2d-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwABBP/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIB/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAEn5cCCeo//xAAaEAACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADBBAj/9oACAEBAAEFAsfnLLAS1ZZjAuv/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAP/aAAgBAwEBPwElv//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oACAECAQE/Aar/xAAbEAACAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQACICEiUf/aAAgBAQAGPwLK2iFSXISLP//EABoQAQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQWH/2gAIAQEAAT8ha0QxjNmL9dZXAXFW9gVfy4AlpP/aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQON//xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEh/9oACAEDAQE/EAON1v/EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIRH/2gAIAQIBAT8Q01GSf//EAB0QAQEAAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQVFhcbH/2gAIAQEAAT8Q5v4LJPOBV29Ky0fdYCQKpZHClHJo9feInBKa5wMFXvn/2Q==\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Caiman"\n        title="Caiman"\n        src="/static/caiman-2ce44e0928c38c4ce5fc2f88157b1f2d-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/caiman-2ce44e0928c38c4ce5fc2f88157b1f2d-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/caiman-2ce44e0928c38c4ce5fc2f88157b1f2d-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/caiman-2ce44e0928c38c4ce5fc2f88157b1f2d-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Osmar told us we were looking for red eyes in the vegetation and it wasn’t long before he found a baby caiman. He told us we could hold it but with the crickets, frogs and mosquitos buzzing and hopping around us we decided not to. He told us a little about them and said its mother would be somewhere in the vegetation too. The black caiman can grow up to six meters long and Osmar told us about the time he had been bitten by a small caiman on his hand. We were pleased when we came out of caiman territory and able to relax on the boat ride back to the lodge.</p>\n<h2>Sunrise in the Amazon</h2>\n<p>We woke up at 05:00 to see the sunrise over Rio Ucayali. Although it was cloudy, there was a gap and when the sun came up it was really orange. Some of the dolphins were about swimming around the boat again. Osmar explained on a good day the sun is really big and lights up the whole of the river. We were happy with the sunrise we’d experienced and crawled back into bed for a siesta.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/sunrise-8cb4e76fb8f36d5d3a4c9cfac03a83cc-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Sunrise"\n        title="Sunrise"\n        src="/static/sunrise-8cb4e76fb8f36d5d3a4c9cfac03a83cc-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/sunrise-8cb4e76fb8f36d5d3a4c9cfac03a83cc-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/sunrise-8cb4e76fb8f36d5d3a4c9cfac03a83cc-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/sunrise-8cb4e76fb8f36d5d3a4c9cfac03a83cc-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Fishing for piranha</h2>\n<p>We went on a day excursion with Osmar and Roland, one of the chef’s in the lodge and a local fisherman. We saw a few lakes and found some land to cook lunch. He made a fire and cooked us rice, chicken and fried plantane. It was delicious, it then absolutely poured it down so it looked like we were out of luck and couldn’t spend the afternoon fishing. There was thunder and lightening and after waiting a while we gave up and headed back to the Lodge. However, it stopped on the way back so Roland pulled into some fishing spots for us to try and catch some dinner.

They were really mean looking and Osmar told us to be careful as they would bite and take a chunk of flesh. Roland later cooked them up for dinner, although they were small the meat on them was really tasty.</p>\n<h2>Snakes</h2>\n<p>We’d been to a lake hunting for snakes basking in the trees but we hadn’t managed to find any. Osmar told us that snakes are very random, on some days he sees none and on others two or three. On the last day he told us he had a surprise for us, we’d gotten used to Osmar and his surprises and usually they didn’t disappoint. He took us around Libertad Village, the kids started to follow us and Osmar told us we were at Roland’s house. Underneath was a wooden box and Osmar said that Roland had caught a three metre long boa constrictor. He explained that it had been caught up in his fishing net, so they had freed it and Roland was waiting for it’s scars to heal before releasing it back into the wild. The kids gathered around underneath the house whilst Omar took the nails out of the top of the box to get it out. It immediately started hissing and going for Osmar and Roland, it sounded angry. When they did manage to get it out you could see how powerful it was and how hard they had to work to stop it from wrapping around their arms and squeezing tightly.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/boa-constrictor-86f65f283403f425ab9d43b85b929e07-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDBP/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIAAf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABtJ3CyDLf/8QAGRABAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxES/9oACAEBAAEFAmvOVveV2mNZ1AyqR//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oACAEDAQE/AVf/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEf/aAAgBAgEBPwGn/8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERIRASMUH/2gAIAQEABj8CWrp+FdJZOf/EABsQAAMBAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESExQVFx/9oACAEBAAE/IV2RDArlPAxxOmlr9V8FHCMUnw//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEOwP/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEhEf/aAAgBAwEBPxBJZSYf/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEhEf/aAAgBAgEBPxB1DWf/xAAdEAACAwACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhQTFRcYGx/9oACAEBAAE/EDQQcUv2OvkUyaCKCvINCALEFxUFMBRxYhtTcPMckUYFp//Z\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Boa constrictor"\n        title="Boa constrictor"\n        src="/static/boa-constrictor-86f65f283403f425ab9d43b85b929e07-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/boa-constrictor-86f65f283403f425ab9d43b85b929e07-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/boa-constrictor-86f65f283403f425ab9d43b85b929e07-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/boa-constrictor-86f65f283403f425ab9d43b85b929e07-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>List of most of the animals we saw in the Pacaya Samira National Reserve;</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Monk saki monkeys</li>\n<li>Common squirrel monkey</li>\n<li>Pygmy marmoset</li>\n<li>Titi monkey</li>\n<li>Capuchin monkey</li>\n<li>Red howler monkey</li>\n<li>Common woolly monkey</li>\n<li>Night owl monkey</li>\n<li>Three-toed sloth</li>\n<li>Pygmy long-nosed bats</li>\n<li>Tree rats</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Pink Amazon river dolphins</li>\n<li>Grey tucuxi dolphins</li>\n<li>Baracuda</li>\n<li>Red-bellied piranha</li>\n<li>Catfish</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon kingfisher</li>\n<li>Green kingfisher</li>\n<li>Scarlett macaws</li>\n<li>Blue and yellow macaws</li>\n<li>Blue capped heron</li>\n<li>Black collared hawk</li>\n<li>Hummingbird</li>\n<li>Small yellow bellied toucan</li>\n<li>White fronted toucan</li>\n<li>Crimson crested woodpeckers</li>\n<li>Cream woodpeckers</li>\n<li>Red cardinals</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Peruvian pinktoed tarantula</li>\n<li>Giant moth</li>\n<li>Millipede</li>\n<li>Beetles</li>\n<li>Golden weaver spider</li>\n<li>Aquatic wandering spider</li>\n<li>Bullet ant</li>\n<li>Grasshopper</li>\n<li>Leafcutter ants</li>\n<li>Army ants</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Iguana</li>\n<li>Boa constrictor</li>\n<li>Tiny tree toad</li>\n<li>Colour geko</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Our verdict on the Amazon Rainforest</h2>\n<p>We absolutely loved the Amazon! It was really relaxing to spend four days without technology, eating local tropical fruits and going out everyday to see animals in the wild. Even though we ended up with more than 100 mosquito bites altogether (we now look like we have chicken pox) and at times were covered in bugs, feeding monkeys and being surrounded by dolphins at sunset was absolutely incredible. We can’t thank Libertad Lodge, our guide Osmar and the locals enough for having us, allowing us to stay in their village and taking us out on their boats to see some of the wildlife in the Amazon.</p>',
