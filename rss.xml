&lt;p&gt;“Ooh Chimpanzee that; Monkey News. This is one of the first Monkey News that I did and I think it’s worth hearing again, just in case you forgot about it, ‘cos it’s sort of classic Monkey News. It’s about this monkey that was knocking about called Ollie…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running theme of Karl Pilkington; The World of Karl Pilkington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One night in São Paulo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used São Paulo to break up our journey as we made our way to Foz do Iguaçu from Paraty. We spent less than 24 hours there and ended up eating our dinner in a shopping mall. As soon as we stepped out of the Metro station and onto the huge boulevard, it became evident as to why São Paulo is known as the ‘financial capital’ of Brazil. There were huge glass skyscrapers on each side of the road, uniquely shaped buildings and three lanes of traffic on each side of the boulevards. However, there was still a sense of underlying poverty in the city. On our walk back from the mall we saw two young boys hitting an empty glass bottle of vodka against the curb until it smashed. They cheered and then jumped onto the doorway of a bus as it was driving off, until the driver opened the door and it shoved them off. They were wearing scruffy clothes and one of them couldn’t have been older than seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had an interesting encounter on the Metro when we arrived, as three young men approached us and asked if we liked Tango. They proceeded to play Tango music right in front of us on their guitars and bandoneón for a couple of stops. What surprised us was that most people on the carriage applauded when they had finished and tipped them. If we had been in England, most people would have looked at their phones and pretended they hadn’t heard anything. We did as the locals did and gave them some of our Brazilian real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehostelpaulista.com.br/pt-br&quot;&gt;Hostel Paulista&lt;/a&gt; goes on our list of one of the grimmest places we’ve stayed. The mattresses were covered in blue plastic, the pillows in a plastic bag and Alz wasn’t provided with a blanket. The bathrooms were another matter altogether, the door had come off the women’s toilet, there were no locks on the showers and there was no toilet paper anywhere in sight after around 10PM. Safe to say after one night, we were glad to leave and carry on with our journey to Foz do Iguaçu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foz do Iguaçu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got off the plane in Foz do Iguaçu, the warm air hit us as we were back in temperatures of around 34C, even the breeze was warm. We opted for a local bus to get us to the hostel as the town seemed small. Getting on the bus with two backpack’s on, one on our back and the other on our front was a nightmare, as the bus had a pointless turnstile in the middle of it, which we had to go through once we’d paid. The woman accepting money for tickets got so annoyed with me trying to get through, she took my backpack from me and threw it over the turnstiles.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had booked to stay at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tetrishostel.com.br/&quot;&gt;Tetris Hostel&lt;/a&gt;, made of shipping containers stacked on top of each other. We were shown to our 12 bed dormitory which was sweltering hot. We immediately thought that staying in a metal containers in such high temperatures was a mistake. However, the hostel offered free Caipriniha’s from 8:00-8:30PM which made it much more bareable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iguazu Falls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on our bucket list and one of the seven natural wonders of the world, we had always expected Iguazu Falls to be spectacular. What we didn’t expect was how long the waterfalls went on for and how big the National Park was, particularly on the Argentinian side. It was so huge we had to ride trains to get around. There are between 150-300 waterfalls in the park depending on the season, leading up to the big one Garganta del Diablo or ‘Devils Throat’.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Brazilian side, the platform out to Garganta del Diablo allowed us to walk to the middle of the river and look through either side of the falls. It was really loud and so powerful, that even from such a distance we were sprayed with the mist caused by the force of the water as hit the rocks. On the Argentinian side, we walked a platform across the top and watched the water as it pummelled down the rocks. The mist was so thick you couldn’t see the rest of the falls or the platform out on the Brazilian side. However, because of the sunshine and the mist, there were some vibrant rainbows that helped to make the perfect photo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also walked the upper and lower trails on the Argentinian side of the falls, which other than seeing the top of Garganta del Diablo, was probably our favourite part of the park because of all of the wildlife we saw. The lower trail also took us very close to a waterfall which was so violent it soaked us with it’s spray and mist, and the water was so loud we had to shout at one another to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were butterflies everywhere in the park, landing on our arms, bags and on people’s heads. Some people held out bits of fruit to attract them and the butterflies would sit on their hands for ages enjoying the sweet fruits. There were also Coati, racoon-like scavengers and there were warnings everywhere about them attacking people for food and that they may have rabies. We saw one woman stupidly sat on a bench eating some biscuits and when a Quito tried to jump up her, she kicked it away. They were however, deceivingly cute.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As there were more walks through the park on the Argentinian side, we saw a lot more wildlife there. There were lots and lots of spiders, some which had made their webs over our heads on the trails, we quickly ran under those. We also spotted a really colourful Toucan up in the tree’s; I managed to snap a photograph before it was scared off by guided tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly we also saw a whole family of capuchin monkeys; we saw a mother with her baby, two fighting and one chilling on a branch in the tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One even came into the crowd of people on it’s two legs, and because everyone was so busy taking pictures of the monkey’s in the trees, no one even noticed. Dan got a pretty good photo of it waving to everyone looking very cheeky.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if the day hadn’t been exciting enough, on one of our train journeys a jeep went past and in the front was a short haired blonde woman, looking very cool eating her ice cream - she looked remarkably like Katy Perry. As it turned out, she was Katy Perry. We heard one of the staff members later telling people she had come today and her presence at Iguazu Falls had even made the local news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crossing the Border&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d heard some horror stories about our intial plan of local transport to cross the border, where buses hadn’t stopped for people to be stamped out of Brazil leading to hefty fines. We got chatting to a Canadian girl in the hostel and she easily convinced us to share a taxi with her and a couple from England to cross the border to the Argentinian side of the falls, which was hassle free and cheaper than the hostel’s day trip to the Argentinian side. The hostel arranged this for us, however when the taxi came, the driver refused to take us as 4 of us had luggage. As it was nonsensical to pay double for two taxi’s on our budgets we went our separate ways and headed for the local bus stop. In actual fact it was pretty straight forward crossing the border from Brazil to Argentina; one bus to the Brazilian border, one bus to the Argentinian border and then another to the bus terminal in Puerto Iguazú. After an hour and a half, we were finally in Argentina and had to rembember to switch from obrigada to gracias. De nada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First thoughts on Argentina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dumped our bags at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.porambahostel.com/&quot;&gt;Poramba Hostel&lt;/a&gt; and headed into town to get some cash out of the ATM so we could head to the falls. The ATM charged us $240ARS (£8.54) to withdraw cash which was a bit of a shock. Apparently standard in the whole of Argentina! The bus was also £5.35 to the falls instead of the 80p it had been the Brazilian side; it became evident very quickly that it would be harder to stick to our budget in Argentina! It had been so much easier in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict Iguazu Falls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we’d initially done our research, people had recommended to visit both sides of the falls and we would totally agree with this. The Brazilian side gives great views from the bottom, but the Argentinian side is huge with unexpected surprises such as Toucan’s, monkeys and if your lucky even a celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ilha Grande & Paraty]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Is it normal to have sweaty ears?

&lt;p&gt;“Is it normal to have sweaty ears? I’ve never had a sweaty ear in my life… They’re not even doing anything and they’re hot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Pilkington on Brazilian weather, An Idiot Abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arriving at Ilha Grande&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four busy days in Rio de Janiero, we’d planned to spend some time relaxing on the beaches of Ilha Grande. We booked a door to door transfer with &lt;a href=&quot;http://easytransferbrazil.com/en/&quot;&gt;Easy Transfers&lt;/a&gt; from Rio to Ilha Grande, we were collected at 07:00 and taken straight to the island; it was around a 3 hour drive and 45 minutes on a slow boat. We sat on the top deck and enjoyed the sunshine and a few beers until we got there. As we approached the ‘Big Island’ we could see why people in Rio had raved about how beautiful it was. There was a small stretch of bars, restaurants and pousada’s, coves of beaches and a pier towered by green hills covering the rest of the island. Dan said that it looked like ‘that island’ from Moana; he meant Te Fiti. The island was supposed to be very secluded with no cars and no ATMS, however on one of our treks we saw a bus full of tourists on the jungle path driving to Dios Rios. Definitely no banks or ATM’s though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the town was so small it didn’t take us long to reach &lt;a href=&quot;http://biergartenhostel.blogspot.com.br/&quot;&gt;Biergarten Hostel&lt;/a&gt;, where we had booked in an 8 bed dormitory to stay. It had two hammocks just outside our room and an odd shaped bench in the kitchen which Alz kept stubbing his toes on.  There was also a buffet style kilo restaurant attached, where we paid for the weight of food on our plates. On our second night in the hostel, new people came into the dorm, including two of the guys who had been at Books Hostel in Rio. One of them was Norweigian and had spent a night in Rio chatting to Alz about politics and finance over Caipirinhas; we joked that Alz had pulled so found it hilarious when he, by coincidence, ended up in our dormitory in the hostel on Ilha Grande. The second guy was from Bristol and snored like a fog horn; he was so loud my Harry Potter audiobook couldn’t drown him out, but at least we got to catch up on some sleep snoozing on the beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common animal we saw on the island were dogs. Lots and lots of dogs. They were everywhere, pooing on the beach, begging for food at night and walking the jungle trails to other parts of the island. We even saw a dead one, decomposing and washed up on the beach by the tide. Dan was highly amused by one dog who had dug a hole in the sand, was sat in it and was wearing a green tie. Some of the dogs seemed to have owners but others were strays and it was upsetting to see them so skinny and begging for food. It also meant that there was poo on the paths and main beach in Vila do Abraão, so we ended up spending most of our time in the little cove beaches slightly out of town.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our first night on the island we spotted a couple of black tufted-ear marmoset’s in the Vila do Abraão on the telephone wires, I managed to take one photo before they ran off and disappeared. As we had read that there were howler monkey’s on the island, we decided to do a bit of a walk through the jungle on the second day to see if we could see any. This wasn’t supposed to be for long as we wanted to chill out on the beach; we were also wearing sandals and had about half a bottle of water between us. We ended up walking along a trail to Dois Rios and at one point we became determined to do the 3-4 hour trek all the way there. However, after reaching a viewpoint we turned back as we were out of water and according to the map we were only about one third of the way there; the sun was out and it was midday so carrying on seemed like a stupid idea. The view was stunning of the bay and it was well worth the hour walk there and back. Sadly, we didn’t see any monkeys, just big ants, butterflies, a few types of birds and a great big spider.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we felt like we’d failed the trail the day before, the next day we decided to hike to Lopes Mendes rather than take the boat trip. This was a 3-hour trek and we were way more prepared, armed with snacks, lots of water, DEET and walking boots. We followed the signs from Vila do Abraão to Lopes Mendes and once we got off the beach and into the jungle we questioned what we’d let ourselves in for. The beginning of the trek was so steep; climbing up steps naturally made from tree roots and holes in the clay ground. We were all soaking in sweat within about 30 seconds and only saw one other person walking the trail who over took us, so it felt like we had the jungle to ourselves. The first part of the hike took us about 2 hours to the first beach, Enseada das Palmas. This was also pretty much deserted, and it was tempting to just stop there; however, we’d read that Lopes Mendes was one of the best beaches in Brazil. We had another 40-minute walk through the jungle to get to the next beach Praia do Pouso and from there we booked our speedboat water taxi back to Vila do Abraão for later in the afternoon. To reach Lopes Mendes we had another 20-minute walk through the jungle, this bit was busier with other visitors who had taken boats from Vila do Abraão to Praia do Pouso, as the boats did not go straight to Lopes Mendes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopes Mendes delivered as promised. The beach was huge and secluded, there were no restaurants or pousada’s there, just a couple of men with their carts selling drinks and snacks. The sand was white and so fine, as we walked along the beach it squeaked beneath our feet. The sea was crystal clear, warm and it was so shallow we could go out really far and the water was only up to our waists.  Even though we were knackered when we got to Lopes Mendes, we felt a sense of achievement. It was well worth the 3 hour trek across the island to get there but we were exceptionally grateful for the speedboat back to Vila do Abraão.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long day we ate at a restaurant called Steak n’ Beach and had a huge mixed grill for the three of us. It came on a sizziling hot plate and consisted of two pork chops, two steaks, two chicken breasts and four Brazilian sausages, accompanied with a bowl of rice, a mound of chips and some salsa. It cost us $145R which is around £32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paraty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days on Ilha Grande we left for Paraty on our Easy Transfer and it took around 4 hours to reach the town from the island. The weather was overcast and it rained for half of our time in Paraty. On our walking tour in Rio, the guide had said that we had come to Brazil at a time where the seasons were changing which meant that the weather was hot but with some rain in the afternoon. Because of the weather, there wasn’t a lot to do in Paraty. For some reason the free walking tours had been cancelled and we didn’t want to risk a boat trip or a bus ride to Trindade to spend the day on the beach as it kept raining on and off. Therefore, we milled around the old town which was very picturesque, with its colourful boats, buildings and cobbled streets. The people of Paraty also seemed to have a fondness for classic VW Beetles, which were colourful and matched the style of the town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was here that we finally saw more monkeys! We were having breakfast in our hostel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sambacanutahostel/&quot;&gt;Samba Canuta&lt;/a&gt; and the staff told us that there were monkeys in the tree’s, they tried to coax them down with banana’s but they were having none of it. They lingered around long enough for me to get some good pictures on my camera though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The hostel itself was very quiet and we were pretty much the only guests staying there, which made the communal areas very awkward as all the staff seemed to do all day was play guitar and sing the Portuguese version of the Eagle’s ‘Hotel California’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verdict on Ilha Grande &amp;#x26; Paraty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ilha Grande didn’t turn out to be such a relaxing destination after all as we did lots of hiking through the jungle across the island. We ended up with around 30 mosquito bites between us, but totally worth it for the beautiful views and beaches. Following this, we enjoyed our chilled out time in Paraty; a beautiful colonial town with lots of character that wasn’t even the rain couldn’t spoil.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rio De Janeiro]]></title><description><![CDATA[“I sorta think from a distance…Jesus, top of a hill, lookin’ like he’s about to bungee jump, you pass it, you go, ‘There he is.

&lt;p&gt;“I sorta think from a distance…Jesus, top of a hill, lookin’ like he’s about to bungee jump, you pass it, you go, ‘There he is. Great. What else are we doin’?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Pilkington, An Idiot Abroad (not bitter at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arriving in Rio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we left for Rio, we were told in many ways about how dangerous it is there. We did a bit of research the night before and read about the trouble following the Rio Olympics. The government arrested some people to make the favela’s safe and promised to make the them better. The Olympics came and went and the government didn’t follow through with any of their promises to improve things such as health and education, which resulted in the violence within the favelas escalating. It seemed from google maps that our hostel was also surrounded by favela’s and we then read that because of the trouble there, the military had taken over the city. Felipe running &lt;a href=&quot;http://bookshostel.com/&quot;&gt;Books Hostel&lt;/a&gt;, where we were staying had also warned us not to take money out at the airport due to credit cards being cloned. To make matters worse, when we arrived in Portugal for a stop over, the lady running the hostel told us about her daughter who had been to Carnival a few weeks ago. She had been staying in Leblon, an area close to the biggest favela in Rio, Rochina, she had heard gunshots in Leblon and saw lots of people running away from the area. She warned us to be careful. This made us question why we were starting our trip in Rio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a horrendous flight we arranged a transfer with the hostel as we arrived so late. The driver pulled up in a Fiat with absolutely blacked out windows and drove us through the streets of Rio, we managed to see Christ the Redeemer lit up on Corcovado mountain. No crimes were witnessed in our first hour of Rio, however at traffic lights we heard people chanting and I thought there was going to be a protest or some sort of gang violence around the corner, it turned out to be football fans chanting in a bar following a Flamengo goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we did in Rio was head to the beach. The guy at the hostel recommended Gloria Beach, which he said was walkable. We didn’t take any valuables with us whilst we were still sussing the city out. However, our visit was trouble free, the sand was white and we had a great view of Sugarloaf Mountain and of Christ, when he didn’t disappear behind the clouds. The people selling beer and drinks were very friendly and it seemed to be full of locals jogging or sunbathing. As it is so infamous, we then got an Uber to Copacabana beach, Dan and Alz warned me that I would prefer Gloria and they were right. Every thirty seconds someone was in our face trying to sell something, sunglasses, empanadas, bikinis, canga (sarongs), caipirinhas and weed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last day in Rio, we did a free walking tour of the Copacabana and Ipanema area. Our guide told us about the World Cup and how everyone gathered in front of the big screens to watch the games on the beach. We went to the restaurant where “The Girl from Ipanema” was written and walked to Lagoa Rodrigues de Freitas to watch the sun go down. The guide gave us some Brazilian snacks to try including Biscoto Globo, a weird banana sweet and some Guarana, an energy drink that tastes like red bull. By this time, we felt much more comfortable and confident in Rio and walked around the most expensive part of town to find some food after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Christ The Redeemer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had seen Christ the Redeemer lit up at night and from Gloria beach, but what’s a trip to Rio without seeing the wonder of the world up close. Following some advice from a dutch girl on our free walking tour of Downtown and Lapa, we decided to do as she did and get an Uber up Corcovado Mountain to see him in all his glory. The driver spoke no english and on the way either stopped in front of a favela to ask for directions or tried to drive through it, we’re still not sure. Either way, luckily a guy wearing an official visitors t-shirt turned him away or told him the right way to go. After getting to the top, we went to buy our ticket, only to be told that there was no visibility at all and the live camera on Christ was just pure white from the cloud. We waited for some time and the boys had more beers, but the cloud didn’t shift and in the end we had to give up and pay excessive amounts to get back down.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on ‘Christ watch’ for the rest of the time in Rio, trying to catch a glimpse of him in a clear sky,  meaning we might get the opportunity to go up again. However, during the last two days of our trip he was completely covered by cloud, except for around thirty seconds when we were watching the sunset on our last night, he peeped out just to rub our noses in the fact that we hadn’t been able to see him up close during our time in Rio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Art &amp;#x26; Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the full Rio experience we decided to do a couple of walking tours to learn about the history and culture of the city. On the tour of Downtown and Lapa we tried Coxinhas, breaded chicken balls with cheese inside (that tasted a bit like mac and cheese balls) and ended up at the bright tiled steps ‘Escadaria Selaron’, a gift from Jorge Selaron to the city which took him over 23 years to finish. They were really bright and vibrant and one of my favourite parts of the city leading to the Santa Teresa neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a wander to Olympic Boulevard during a pretty loud thunderstorm, one strike of lightning was so close and so loud it made the lady crossing the road next to Alz grab his arm. At Olympic Boulevard we saw probably the best street art we’ve seen in any city we’ve been to so far. It was a huge mural by Eduardo Kobra completed for the Olympics; it was so colourful and vibrant and represented the five continents of the games. On the way we also visited the very ugly Cathedral which is inspired by a Mayan Pyramid, Dan repeatedly told us that “beauty comes from within”. It looked a bit like the old Birmingham Library before it was torn down.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a good view of the city, we decided instead of paying extortionate amounts for Sugarloaf and risking the cloud of Corcovado Mountain we walked up the very steep hill to Santa Teresa, the hipster ‘foodie’ area of Rio. On the way Alz got a bit cocky and jumped up a steep step, resulting in his shorts tearing along the crotch. We got a good panoramic view of the city from Parque Das Ruinas, except for Christ, who remained behind the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Rio seeming to be a city that never sleeps, where the fruit and vegetable stores are open until the early hours of the morning, we had heard that the city is very quiet on a Sunday, and what we heard wasn’t a lie. The only places open seemed to be McDonalds and Starbucks. As there wasn’t a lot to do, we went to the Modern Art Museum, Alz and Dan particularly enjoyed mocking Giacometti’s “Four Women on Base”. We then went to the Museu Historico Nacional which was free on a Sunday; we pretty much had the museum to ourselves as it was so quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food &amp;#x26; Caipirinhas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hostel where we stayed sold £1 Caipirinhas, either lime or passionfruit and we definitely had our fill of these, they have possibly rocketed to one of our favourite cocktails. Something which took some time getting used to was that everyone shared 600ml bottles of beer, we got very strange looks when we tried to order one each so followed the Carioca trend and shared and drank from teeny tiny glasses. On Alz’s birthday we went to a local restaurant called Os Ximenes; we had two massive steaks, Brazilian sausage, scrambled egg in Farofa, a tasteless brazilian flour, rice and chips. It was delicious although covered in about three bulbs of diced garlic. Safe to say we stank the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Rio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from being hot, Rio really wasn’t what we had expected it to be, it was so much better. It was diverse, colourful, vibrant and full of life. We barely touched the surface in four days and as we didn’t get to see Christ the Redeemer up close, one day we’ll definitely go back.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
