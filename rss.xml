&lt;p&gt;We ended up bringing our plans forward to visit Malaysia as we decided to cut out Bali and Lombok, given the reoccurring earthquakes, the Gili’s being off the cards and the UK government advice, so we headed straight to Kuala Lumpur from New Zealand. Our flights were long and we ended up visiting four countries in 24 hours; Christchurch (NZ) to Brisbane (Aus) to Bali (Indonesia) and finally Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’d had a lush hotel booked for Dan’s birthday in Ubud with an infinity pool and a luxury room, we tried desperately to find the equivalent last minute in Kuala Lumpur. We struggled! Eventually we managed to find an Airbnb in Marc Residence, just a few minutes walk away from the Petronas Towers. From the outside the building looked posh, but the pool was constantly filled with children and the studio apartment was a massive disappointment. We had no hot water and a blocked shower drain for 24 hours, no pots and pans to cook with and it wasn’t the cleanest. However it was pretty central and as Kuala Lumpur is such a big city we barely spent any time there anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KLCC was a nice area, we ate at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.naughtynuris.com.my/&quot;&gt;Naughty Nuris&lt;/a&gt; in the Life Centre on Dan’s birthday and there were lots of bars and restaurants around. The mall near the Petronas Towers was really posh with a Tiffany’s and lots of other upmarket stores selling goods with 0% GST for the holiday period (1st June until 1st September 2018) but the shopping was still well out of our budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Malls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuala Lumpur is filled with malls and places to eat. Malaysian pastime is to shop, eat, eat some more, shop and eat again. The first mall we visited was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midvalley.com.my/&quot;&gt;Megamall&lt;/a&gt;, it was quite far out of the city so we took a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grab.com/my/&quot;&gt;Grab&lt;/a&gt;. Grab is a great service in Malaysia, like Uber but better. You can collect rewards and use promo codes to get money off and once you’ve searched for a journey the price is locked in, even if the driver cancels. As there was two of us, Grab mostly turned out to be cheaper than paying for public transport and it was much quicker despite the city traffic. The Megamall was huge, like all the malls, it had 6-7 floors, English shops like Topshop and Sports Direct and a huge food court. There was even a pet shop selling the usual birds, fish, rabbits alongside cats and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up visiting many more malls. &lt;a href=&quot;https://berjayatimessquarekl.com/&quot;&gt;Times Square Mall&lt;/a&gt; had 12 floors and an indoor theme park with a rollercoaster that goes around the mall. This had Malaysian branded clothes and I managed to pick up a Disney tshirt for 12.90MYR which is £2.50. We went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pavilion-kl.com/&quot;&gt;The Pavillion&lt;/a&gt; which was slightly posher with shops like Michael Kors and Armani. Another was called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nusentral.com/&quot;&gt;NU Sentral&lt;/a&gt; with high street shops and more food. Our favourite was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lot10.com.my/&quot;&gt;Lot 10&lt;/a&gt;, not just because it had a H&amp;#x26;M, but for the Hawker Market in the basement. We ate there one evening trying different street food dishes including dim sum, noodles and spring rolls. One of our Grab drivers explained why there are so many malls in Kuala Lumpur; he told us that it is hot in Kuala Lumpur all year round and families visit the malls during the weekends to make use of the air conditioning and get out of the heat, which is exactly what we had been doing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bukit Bitang&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area was really touristy especially after it got dark. It was filled with malls (surprise surprise), along with restaurants and bars. We headed to the main street for a drink one evening in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rabbithole.com.my/&quot;&gt;The Rabbit Hole&lt;/a&gt; but it wasn’t really our kind of place, filled with Irish bars and tacky clubs. Considering everything is so cheap in Kuala Lumpur, the alcohol was pricey! It wasn’t really more than what we’d been paying in New Zealand but food was so cheap it meant that a beer was more than a meal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Muzium Negara&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuala Lumpur is a massive city and there weren’t any good free walking tours that we could find. As we wanted to learn a bit more about Malaysian history, we decided to visit the national museum, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.muziumnegara.gov.my/&quot;&gt;Muzium Negara&lt;/a&gt;. It cost 5MYR (£1) to visit and we spent a couple of hours there. The museum is like a timeline of Malaysian history from the Paleozoic era and the first signs of life until the modern day. There were really interesting parts and we learned that Malaysia came to life because of Malacca, a city south of Kuala Lumpur that was important for trade - set in the middle of Asia and India. It’s tolerant of all people and religions because of its roots stemming from immigration and its trade routes. We learned that Portugal invaded for control of Malacca in 1511, followed by the Dutch in 1614 and then the Brits took over in 1841 to control the administration side of trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part of the museum was the modern history. We learned that Japan took control of Malaysia during WW2 and after the war there were communist guerrilla groups and schools educating in english, which prompted Malaysia to start their fight for independence. This was achieved on 31st August 1957 which explained all of the Malaysian flags plastered all over Kuala Lumpur in preparation for their Independence Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merdeka Square&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited Merdeka Square on a hot afternoon to see the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, which was pretty impressive. Luckily the road was closed as it was a Sunday which meant we were able to get some good photos of the building standing in the middle of the six lane road.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also queued for a picture by the ‘I love KL’ sign, and visited the Sri Mahamariamman Temple but we didn’t go in as we had to remove our shoes and leave them on the street. We’d also come unprepared without socks and didn’t fancy walking around barefoot on the city pavement. The outside was very intricate and colourful and not like anything we’d seen before! In Merdeka Square, whilst we were waiting for a Grab, an Asian girl, around 10 years old asked if she could have a photograph with me. We got lots of stares in Kuala Lumpur as we were the ethnic minority; most tourists seemed to be from nearby Asian countries and it was the first time we’d felt this way on our trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Central Market was possibly my favourite place in Kuala Lumpur. It wasn’t new and shiny like the malls but wasn’t dirty and smelly like the markets in South America. It was full of souvenirs and had different areas - Malay, India and China. We even ate in there getting a delicious Pad Thai for just over £3. We found a stall selling lucky Malaysian cats (the waving ones) made from porcelain and decided to invest in one to bring us good fortune when we return to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chinatown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed to Chinatown in the evening and it was heaving. It was full of market stalls with everything fake you could imagine; watches, make up, jewellery, bags, shoes, tshirts and caps. Dan managed to find a fake Nigeria football shirt he had been after since he’d seen it before the World Cup, I brought some obligatory elephant trousers for 20MYR (£4) and Dan got the iconic Tiger vest. The street food there we felt was questionable as the area was poorly maintained so we didn’t eat there, except for a bag of roasted chestnuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Batu Caves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batu_Caves&quot;&gt;Batu Caves&lt;/a&gt; are one of the main attractions in Kuala Lumpur. The caves are a Hindu Shrine with a huge Hindu statue of Lord Murugan measuring 140ft high. We got a Grab there, which was 24MYR (£5) and took around 20 minutes. The main Cathedral Cave was free to enter but it was sadly under renovation so everything was covered in blue tarpaulin. However the parts that were being painted that we could see were really colourful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were loads of monkeys at the temples too and we’d read that we shouldn’t make eye contact with them and that they would attack for food. However so many tourists were feeding them, we saw young children pretending they had food in their hands so that the monkeys would come over and sit on their laps to open their hands, only to find there was nothing there. We thought it was amazing that no one was bitten!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dark Cave and Cavevilla both had entry fees and we decided not to visit these. The Dark Cave was pitch black and you can only enter on a guided tour. It’s main attraction is the trapdoor spiders, the most elusive spider in the world that trap prey in its ‘door’. The Cavevilla cave was more like a zoo and I’d read reviews before we went which said that the enclosures are small and it’s a sad and sorry site. We’d read that the Ramayana Cave was free to enter but when we visited it was 5MYR per person. As a pound wasn’t going to break the bank, we paid and had a look around. There were lots of statues which depicted the story of Rama. It was worth having a look and made our visit worthwhile. As we couldn’t get any WiFi to get a Grab back into the city, we had little choice other than to get the train. The train comes approximately once an hour and we’d luckily managed to time it so we weren’t waiting long. It cost 3MYR each, less than a pound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Kuala Lumpur&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Kuala Lumpur, it was a great place to shop and replenish our backpacks, and the food was incredible!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Christchurch & Kaikoura, New Zealand]]></title><description><![CDATA[Christchurch After a roast pork and gravy sandwich (the most English place we could find to eat in Dunedin) at  Bacon Buttie Station , we…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//christchurch-and-kaikoura/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//christchurch-and-kaikoura/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 Aug 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Christchurch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a roast pork and gravy sandwich (the most English place we could find to eat in Dunedin) at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.baconbuttiestation.com/&quot;&gt;Bacon Buttie Station&lt;/a&gt;, we caught our Intercity bus to Christchurch. This took around six hours to get there. We only had one day in Christchurch as we decided to lengthen our time in Kaikoura giving us a more opportunity to see the whales. This meant we had little time to explore the city, but a day was probably enough anyway. We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://aroundtheworld.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Around the World Backpackers&lt;/a&gt; which was a converted old school and a little out of the city centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city itself is still being rebuilt after the earthquake on Tuesday 22 February 2011, a magnitude 6.3 which caused severe damage in Christchurch and Lyttelton, killing 185 people and injuring several thousand. It is estimated that it will take 20 years to return Christchurch to the city that it was and the scale of the damage is evident even now. There was lots of scaffolding all over the city, lots of buildings being propped up and lots of land where buildings once stood, now being used a public car parks. The spire was no longer on top of the cathedral and it’s boarded off like a derelict building. The most harrowing was the ‘185 White Chairs Memorial’ to represent the 185 people who died in the earthquake; one of the chairs was a highchair, the other a baby car seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked the city, watched the tram drive by, paid a visit to Rememberence Bridge and North Hagley Park. We also walked to one of the suburbs to see Brockworth Street Art gallery, which was a little underwhelming after seeing some of the other graffiti around Europe and South America. As the city is being rebuilding, almost from scratch, there are lots of new quirky looking bars to visit so after a Thai meal we went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesmashpalace.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Smash Place&lt;/a&gt;, although it was pretty dead on a Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kaikoura&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaikoura is three hours from Christchurch and really we’d used Christchurch as a break up in the journey from Dunedin. We arrived in Kaikoura to cloudy and rainy weather which went into the morning of the next day, the morning we had booked to go whale watching. We stayed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://duskylodgebackpackers.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Dusky Lodge&lt;/a&gt; in the small township of Kaikoura, which is mostly just one main street. There wasn’t much to explore so we mooched around the supermarket stocking up on our last western goodies and made the most of the log fire in the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whale Watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning of whale watching was rainy and visibility across the sea was poor so we were pretty shocked that the boat wasn’t being postponed. And of course, there were rough sea’s and a sea sickness warning. After stocking up on @ease tablets and ginger and manuka honey sweets to try and curb any forboding sea sickness we checked in and boarded the boat. There is only one whale watching company in Kaikoura called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whalewatch.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Whale Watch Kaikoura&lt;/a&gt; and its $150 (£72)for a 2.5 hour whale watching tour. The staff recommended sitting at the back as the boat is a little smoother so we did. They really weren’t lying when they gave the warning of rough sea’s, the boat was rocking all over the place and the waves were so high that they kept covering the horizon line which I was desperately trying to focus on to avoid being sick. Around 10 people on the boat were sick which was horrificly unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captain of the boat drove us out to Kaikoura Canyon, where the water is around 1000 meters deep and where their resident sperm whales feed on squid. The captain used sonor equipment to listen to the sound of the whales and to try and track one down for us, the closest we got was after a plane radioed one in but by the time we got there the staff just saw its tail as it dived back into the deep water. The tour felt completely frantic and sadly after two and a bit hours, we had to give up and we were offered an 80% refund. As we had changed our bus back to Christchurch to 16:40 we had the next morning to try again so we moved the tour free of charge. The only catch was that the only boat that wasn’t booked up was 07:15AM. We figured that although we’d be up early if we were unlucky enough to not see a whale again, we could at least book a flight in the early afternoon and try our luck from the skies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather was much nicer on our second attempt and we were up early enough to see a beautiful sunrise! We were told the sea’s were much calmer today but I still medicated up, just in case. We headed out to the boat and the staff told us that their brother vessel was already out in the ocean and had located a sperm whale, he had just been on the surface and gone down for a dive. The staff told us that the sperm whales dive for 45-60 minutes and come up to re-oxygenate for 10-15 minutes so we had a good chance of catching him come up for air. The sea was much calmer than the previous day and there was loads more wildlife around. As the boat stopped and the captain tried to track the whale we saw loads of albatross and other sea birds. The captain told us he could hear the whale clicking, which meant he was hunting. Once it went silent, the staff told us to look out for the blow in the ocean. It wasn’t long until we saw the top of a whale spurting out water. It was a really overwhelming moment after waiting around 3.5 hours in total to see one of these huge animals out in the ocean. We watching him for around 10 minutes blowing air out of his blowhole, with a snowy peaked mountain range in the distance and the sun still rising. It was so idyllic and the complete opposite to our experience the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the whale had dived back under and everyone had ‘the picture’ of his tail out of the water before he went back in, the captain drove us out to find a pod of dusky dolphins. The pod was really scattered but there were hundreds of them showing off, jumping in and out of the water and chasing the boat. Not only were there dolphins but the seals were also putting on a show for us too jumping out of the water or chilling on their backs bobbing about in the water. There was a boat where people were swimming with the dolphins and seals; we thought they were really brave given how cold it was!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kaikoura Peninsula Walk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the unsuccessful whale watching tour, the weather brightened up immediately after we had come back to shore and we decided to do the 3-4 hour hike around the Kaikoura Peninsula. We walked along the black beach and had a look around the old marina and there were the odd fur seals dotted around on the rocks. After around an hour or so of walking we reached the Kaikoura fur seal colony. We literally stumbled across them, as we turned the corner there were two seals sleeping in the sun on the path.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were signs everywhere saying stay 10 meters away from the seals as they can attack and we’d read not to get between them and their route to the sea. However, we saw very stupid tourists standing around 1 meter behind the seals to get their selfies. As the tide was out the rocks went out some distance and there were some people quite far out so we had a wander out to where there were even more seals. The rocks were quite slippy and there was clearly a channel at one part as we had to step over some puddles of water. Concious that the tide might come in we had a quick look at the seals on either side of the rocky area. However as we headed back we realised the tide had been coming in and the channel was filling up. It had filled up so much that there weren’t enough rocks surfacing the water for us to hop across. Our only option was to walk through the sea with our boots on.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After panicking and reaching the other side, we both had very squealchy shoes so decided to head back to Kaikoura the way we came rather than walk up the hill on the peninsula for a view and back around the other way. Definitely an adventure and the closest we had managed to get to the exceptionally cute fur seals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Christchurch &amp;#x26; Kaikoura&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t spend long in Christchurch but it’s somewhere worth a bit of time. We did want to visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canterburymuseum.com/whats-on/quake-city/&quot;&gt;Quake City&lt;/a&gt; but it cost $20 entry so decided against it. Kaikoura was another of my favourite places on the South Island; our second attempt at whale watching was incredible and definitely something I would do again!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dunedin, New Zealand]]></title><description><![CDATA[“I gotta say God really outdid himself down here…” Bob Harper.

&lt;p&gt;“I gotta say God really outdid himself down here…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Harper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dunedin City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Intercity bus from Queenstown to Dunedin took around six hours and it was less luxurious than the Great Sights buses we had been on along the west coast. Dunedin was different to other New Zealand cities, it felt much older than others like it was stuck in the 1990s. It reminded us of the UK, especially when we walked past the towering Cadbury Factory, the railway station and a shop selling Scottish souvenirs. Dunedin was founded by the Scottish Free Church in 1848 and was built to be the Scotland of the south, which explained a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had three days in Dunedin, so once we had checked into &lt;a href=&quot;https://on-top-backpackers-nz.book.direct/&quot;&gt;On Top Backpackers&lt;/a&gt; and Dan had gotten over the excitement of the free pool tables downstairs, we headed out to explore the city. We did a self-guided graffiti walk in the city, a lot of this was in the more industrial part with the garages, art workshops and charity shops. Dan decided to buy the Lord of the Rings Triology (the book!!) in a second hand bookshop.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the centre there were a lot of bars and it was evident that Dunedin is a student city. There were also a number of vintage shops, which were giving the bits that they couldn’t sell away for free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Settlers Museum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one of our days in Dunedin, we headed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toituosm.com/&quot;&gt;The Settlers Museum&lt;/a&gt; to learn the history of the area. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://otagomuseum.nz/&quot;&gt;Otago Museum&lt;/a&gt; was quite far out of town and other than catching a bus to a beach or a hill in the suburbs, there wasn’t a lot else to do. The museum was interesting, but given that we had visited Te Papa and now had a good understanding of New Zealand’s very brief history, there wasn’t much in there that we hadn’t already read about before. It was definitely worth a visit though even to see the exhibitions of old vehicles and household goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife Encounters Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penguins were the entire reason we had planned to go to Dunedin. There are penguins all along the coast but Dunedin was the easiet to reach without forking out more money for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://booking.headfirsttravel.com/bottombus/&quot;&gt;Bottom Bus&lt;/a&gt; to explore the very south of New Zealand. We booked with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elmwildlifetours.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Elm Wildlife Tours&lt;/a&gt; and we were picked up at 13:00 in a minivan with three other people and driven out to the coast. Our first stop was to see the royal albatross who come to the coast near Dunedin to lay their eggs. Our guide pointed out a number of other birds on the way and we saw a family of kingfishers, around 7 altogether in a tree and along a fence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide told us that the family who used to live in the lighthouse ate the first albatross eggs, when they first came to New Zealand to lay their eggs, but then realised that it was a special bird and the area is now a preserved conservation area. The edge of the cliff where the albatross lay their eggs wasn’t accessible without a guided tour, but we did wait around for about an hour to see if we could see one flying. Sadly it wasn’t our lucky day and we left after seeing hundreds of seagull and some shags nesting in a different cliff face.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then headed to the area to see fur seals, sea lions, yellow-eyed and blue penguins. The guide told us that the beach belongs to two farms who have given them access to the beach. There were lots of fur seals lying on the rocks; all mothers and their pups. One was wailing and the guide told us that the seals mothers will go out to sea to hunt and leave the pups on land in the colony. She pointed out that the one crying was skinnier than the others so it was likely that its mother had not returned. The baby seal looked really distressed and approached another mother who had her pup; the mother barked and chased it away. The guide told us that the baby seals will try and go to a different mother, but they won’t have it. Basically, the baby seal was going to starve to death. Alone. I was heartbroken.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked further down to the beach and as we walked across the dunes we were able to get about a meter away from the sleeping sealions. The guide explained that they are all males and they wait on the beach to hunt the penguins. It wasn’t long before a yellow-eyed penguin came in from the sea. He had a good look around for the sealions and did a wide walk around them on the beach before ducking under the fence to go to his nest. The guide told us that the penguins are really good at spotting the sealions and they walk around a kilometre up the hill into the farm to their nests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the beach was a viewing hut with lots of nests for blue penguins around, these are the smallest penguins in the world but they don’t come back into land until dark so our chances of seeing one were basically nil. Up on the cliff were a number of yellow-eyed penguins who had all come in after a day of hunting and they were oiling up their feathers with oil from a gland near their bums. We saw around 8-10 of them come in, usually in groups of 2 or more and they came in as far from the sealions as they could. We watched a lot of them hop up the cliff face to go to their nests and as we walked back to the bus we saw that some of them were in the field with the sheep! The guide said that the lambs often get curious of the penguins and will go to explore their nests; until the penguins bite them on the nose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Dunedin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunedin gave us a taster of some of the wildlife in the south and had we had a car we definitely would have ended up driving further south to Oamaru to see the blue penguins come in from the beach and down to the Caitlins. There were also some dark sky reserves nearby which we missed out on visiting to see the stars (and possibly the southern lights) as we were car less! Definitely another place where we felt limited on public transport, but Dunedin was definitely worth a visit!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Queenstown & Mount Cook, New Zealand]]></title><description><![CDATA[“There’s only one word for New Zealand - EPIC.” Bear Grylls.

&lt;p&gt;“There’s only one word for New Zealand - EPIC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Grylls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Queenstown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we told people we were travelling to New Zealand, many people told us we would love Queenstown so we had high expectations! The journey from Wanaka to Queenstown was a short one on a mini bus and the driver told us about Central Otago, the fruit, veg and wine grown there and we made a short stop in Cromwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to Queenstown, we understood why people would like it here. The town is completely surrounded by mountains and as it was winter they had snowy peaks! There were lots of restuarants, bars and skiing and outdoors shops.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Queenstown’s most infamous attractions is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fergburger.com/&quot;&gt;Fergburger&lt;/a&gt;, a restaurant with incredible burgers. Every time we walked past there was a huge queue out of the door and once we tried it we knew why! Dan had a ‘Bullseye’ and I had a regular Fergburger with Brie cheese. They were immense! Dans was basically a ribeye steak in a bun that was cooked so well it melted in our mouths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hostels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Queenstown for three nights, went to Mount Cook National Park for one night and then returned to Queenstown for another night before making our way to Dunedin. The first stint in Queenstown was spent in a 6 bed dorm in a hostel called &lt;a href=&quot;http://absoloot.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Absoloot Value&lt;/a&gt;. The first night we were there we were woken up by three Aussie girls at 2AM who had gone out partying. We had to be up at 6AM for our bus to Milford Sound. They came in banging around, all three snored and one decided to sleep in just her thong, so I had a ‘cracking’ view of her almost bare arse from the top bunk. Dan and I got back to sleep around 4AM. The second night an English guy came back at 1AM banging on the door as his key wouldn’t work. He then had a telephone conversation with someone very loudly in the dorm and told them he didn’t like being in a dorm with so many women. The third night was less eventful but we were still woken up by a guy and his very loud snoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we returned to Queenstown we decided there was no way we were going back to Absoloot, and with private rooms being really extortionate we decided to go for a double pod in a shared room. We hoped that the dorm would be filled with other couples and we figured that if anyone snored their partner would shut them up. The risk was that the other couples may not have any problems with being intimate in a shared space. Sleep deprived, we decided it was a risk worth taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tahunapodhostel.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Sir Cedrics Tahuna Pod Hostel&lt;/a&gt; and the hostel itself was really nice, clean, free soup, breakfast, popcorn and free use of hair straighteners! Our room mates on the other hand were something else altogether. After we’d eaten we came back to the room, showered and got into our pod, shutting the curtain so we had our own little bit of space. The couple got down from the bunk above us and started to get ready to go out. Whilst we were sorting photos, writing blogs and catching up on social media the two of them were having a very loud conversation, from which we established the following; the guys girlfriend had been cheating on him with his mate called Duncan, he had found out today, they had been together for five years, she had left and taken most of her things, they were travelling together, the woman with him was an escort, she was 20 years old with a 6 month old baby, she was English but lives in Australia, being intimate was not in their contract but they went to shower together and were very intimate with one another when they got back in the middle of the night, the guy asked the escort to call him ‘daddy’ and asked if she could pretend to be his ex-girlfriend whilst they went out to meet a friend. The whole situation was so surreal it was funny, we complained to the hostel the following day who charged the couple for the price of our bed for the night and gave us a lovely little refund!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Queenstown Hill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we did in Queenstown was a hike up the hill for views of the town, this was free compared to the extortionate price of the gondola. It took around 3.5 hours return and all the way up to the summit, was an uphill slog made slightly more bareable by the Douglas Fir Christmas trees around us. At the summit we were rewarded with great views of Queenstown, Lake Wakatipu and the surrounding mountains ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Milford Sound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked our day trip to Milford Sound via &lt;a href=&quot;http://bookme.co.nz/&quot;&gt;bookme.co.nz&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jucycruise.co.nz&quot;&gt;Jucy Cruise&lt;/a&gt;. We were picked up at 07:15 for the five hour drive to Milford Sound, located in Fjordland National Park. About 10 minutes into the journey the bus was playing up and the driver dropped us by the side of the road and told us he needed to go and get a different bus as he was worried this one would break down. Twenty minutes later he was back with another bus explaining that he needed to make up the time as the boat at Milford wouldn’t wait for us. Despite this, he still managed to make a number of stops on the way, we stopped at a Lord of the Rings filming location, by a lake which was like a mirror and at a stream where some Kea were milling about. Kea are a big green alpine parrot and they apparently like to pick rubber off cars and steal valubles. The two that were there posed for photos for us and stayed out of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed through a tunnel in the mountains and went past a lot of avalanche warnings. Five hours later we arrived at Milford Sound. Sadly we found our cruise a little disappointing which wasn’t helped by the weather! The pictures that advertise Milford Sound are always blue skies, green lush mountainsides full of waterfalls. However the reality is Milford Sound is the wettest place in New Zealand so it is often cloudy. Unfortunately for us, it wasn’t raining either meaning that there weren’t as many waterfalls so it felt a little bare and dreary. It’s such a popular tourist spot that we also felt like cattle being herded around all day; all the coaches made the same photo stops and there were a lot of people on the boat. I dread to think what its like in summer!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out on top deck it was really hard to hear what the captain was saying over the tannoy as he ferried us around Milford Sound so we missed a lot of the information given too. In the two hours on the water we cruised through one of the fjords and back again at a very slow pace, stopping by some of the waterfalls and by the resting place of some New Zealand fur seals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fjords were really beautiful but Milford Sound felt like a tourist trap compared to everywhere else we had been in New Zealand, where we had been able to enjoy the countryside mostly in peace. After we booked the trip we heard about a just as beautiful but less visited fjord called Doubtful Sound and given the choice again, we would have visited this instead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Remarkables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our glacier landing at Fox was cancelled, we decided to try our luck in Queenstown. Although we wouldn’t be landing on a glacier, just on a snowy peak it worked out much cheaper on &lt;a href=&quot;book.co.nz&quot;&gt;bookme.co.nz&lt;/a&gt; with [The Helicopter Line] at £85 per person for a 30 minute ride. We were picked up from Queenstown, checked in and in a helicopter within 20 minutes. It took about 5 minutes to fly up to The Remarkables. Flying in a helicopter was a really weird sensation, unlike a plane, we felt like we were being lifted up by a rope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view from the top was incredible, we could see the ski field, Queenstown, Arrowtown, Lake Hayes and loads of other mountains surrounding the valley. After 10 minutes of taking in the view and snapping some photos it was time to fly back down again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mount Cook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent one night in Mount Cook National Park. It’s a dark sky reserve and we were hoping to see a sky full of stars. However we had more bad luck with the weather as the entire time we were there it rained and was cloudy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a four hour drive to Mount Cook from Queenstown and again the Great Sights driver made lots of photo stops along the way, Lake Pukaki, Linders Pass and one for a good view of Mount Cook whilst there was a passing bit of blue sky and no low cloud. We were dropped at our accommodation for the night &lt;a href=&quot;https://aorakialpinelodge.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Mount Cook Alpine Lodge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we couldn’t check in, we headed straight out and had a quick look around the visitor centre. This was all about Mount Cook and although there was lots of information, it didn’t appear to be in a chronological order so it was difficult to follow. We then decided to hike to Hooker Lake on the Hooker Trail. It was a 4 hour return walk and luckily after about an hour the rain stopped, although the wind picked up. It was a pretty flat trail but we had to cross three swing bridges to get to the lake. Dan went across the second one first whilst I took a few photos but he got half way and then as the bridge started swinging in the wind, he ran back with a horrified look on his face saying he wouldn’t cross it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, with a little bit of kicking and screaming, we reached Hooker Lake and it was stunning with the backdrop of the mountains and the glaciers. The lake was frozen on top and there were some icebergs in the water that had broken off the glacier. The National Park was really stunning and possibly one of our favourite places in New Zealand!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Queenstown &amp;#x26; Mount Cook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we could see the appeal of Queenstown, it definitely wasn’t our favourite place in New Zealand. However we loved Mount Cook and the hike to Hooker Lake; the scenery was just stunning!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lake Wanaka, New Zealand]]></title><description><![CDATA[The drive We took a Great Sights bus from Fox to Wanaka, our driver Pete gave us loads of great commentary on the picturesque roads all the…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//lake-wanaka/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//lake-wanaka/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Aug 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;The drive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a Great Sights bus from Fox to Wanaka, our driver Pete gave us loads of great commentary on the picturesque roads all the way there. He spoke very slowly and Dan said he reminded him of Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. We stopped a number of times on the way for photo opportunities and to break up the 6 hour journey. The first stop was Bruce Bay where often Hectors dolphins can be spotted. Despite the rain we jumped out of the bus but sadly didn’t see any. The next stop was a salmon farm where we saw a large white heron, one of New Zealand’s rarest birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove past a number of lakes, crossed multiple bridges over rivers and drove through bush. The scenery was stunning all the way even with the low cloud and rain. Pete told us about the little village Haast as we went through which is the remotest place to live in New Zealand. We also stopped at thunder creek falls, a big waterfall and had a stop by Lake Wanaka. All the stops and commentary really broke up a long day and we were pleased when we finally got to Wanaka.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had booked a private room at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wanakabakpaka.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Wanaka Bakpaka&lt;/a&gt; which was a little out of town. It was a nice hostel with great views of the lake and Roy’s Peak behind it. We liked the township of Wanaka, there were lots of outdoor shops as there are so many ski fields around and lots of bars and restaurants for apres ski. We went out for drinks both nights we stayed in Wanaka and made the most of the happy hours there! Our favourite place was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ginandraspberry.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Gin &amp;#x26; Raspberry&lt;/a&gt; and we managed to treat ourselves to an Amaretto Sour and an Espresso Martini there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;That Wanaka Tree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iconic image of Wanaka is the tree, sat alone in the lake. It is just on the edge of the township so once the rain had stopped we had a walk to it. It was very picturesque with the clear water of the lake and the backdrop of the mountains but some people were having a full on photo shoot with the tree. It is known as the lonely tree which we felt was ironic considering the number of people taking pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walk to Ironside Hill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially when we had been looking at hikes in the surrounding area of Wanaka we had wanted to climb Roy’s Peak which is approximately a 6-7 hour hike. However, the majority of the time we were in Wanaka the summit of the mountain was covered in cloud so we knew we’d have terrible views over the lake and surrounding mountain ranges. The other problem was that as it was winter the summit was covered in snow and ice so we’d been advised to go as far as we could and we’d then have to turn around. With no guarantee as to how high we’d get up there and what kind of view we’d have we gave it a miss and opted for a walk around the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed in the direction of Glendhu Bay but never made it that far round. We hiked in total for 16km and went as far as Ironside Hill, a steep hill coming out into the bay. The view from the top was glorious especially as we had a bit of blue sky and a hint of sunshine. We were able to see some of the Pisa Ranges in Aspiring National Park and we had a great view of the lake. The only downside was that the hill was so steep I went down most of it on my arse, slipping right at the end, covering my leggings in mud and rabbit droppings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Wanaka&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We liked the atmosphere of Wanaka, with the cute bars and restaurants without it being too much of a party town. We had heard that Wanaka is like what Queenstown used to be, before it became super popular. The lake was stunning and definitely somewhere to come back to in the summer (along with Tongariro National Park) for a hike to the summit of Roy’s Peak!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nelson & Fox, New Zealand]]></title><description><![CDATA[Nelson Our journey to Nelson was a long but interesting one.

&lt;p&gt;Our journey to Nelson was a long but interesting one. Having set our alarm for 6am, we had a 25 minute walk from our hostel to the train station for the Interisland shuttle bus to the ferry. We were following specific instructions on the InterCity website but we saw the same shuttle drive past locations much closer to our hostel which was a bit annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we were settled on the shuttle and seconds before we were due to leave, the arsehole ranted at length about in our &lt;a href=&quot;/rotorua/&quot;&gt;Rotorua blog&lt;/a&gt; got on. You can imagine what we were thinking at this point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We boarded the ferry and due to Soph’s tendency to feel seasick we sat on the upper deck. It was bitterly cold so we kept going inside and out but the views of Marlborough Sounds on the approach to Picton were incredible. Unfortunately we didn’t see any whales but 20 different types have been spotted in the waters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we arrived at Picton we found our InterCity bus to Nelson and you will never guess who got on. Yep, the arsehole again. Soph had made camp near the front of an empty bus and he decided to sit adjacent  us. Fortunately though he didn’t get his washing line and wet clothes out to dry! We soon moved further back as the bus was pretty much empty when it departed. The bus driver was very vocal throughout the journey and reminded me of an old school radio DJ as he cracked the same lame jokes about having ‘Windows live’ on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nelson was our first glimpse of the south island and we noticed the lack of indigenous names. We had previously read that during the early settlements in New Zealand, the majority were in the north island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The centre of New Zealand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arriving and dumping our stuff at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bridgebackpackers.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Bridge Backpackers&lt;/a&gt;, we were recommended to do the walk up Botanical Hill to the centre of New Zealand as it was a Sunday and most places were shut. It only took us about half an hour to reach the top which had nice views over Nelson and Tasman Bay just as the sun was setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abel Tasman National Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day we had booked with Sea Shuttle for a cruise and hike around Abel Tasman National Park for $86 (£44). The cruise was interesting at points but felt more like a water taxi as people got dropped off at different beaches for their hikes, work or because they lived there. We did get to see several New Zealand fur seals as they sun bathed on the rocks and played in the sea. We also saw New Zealand’s most photographed rock, named split apple rock.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were dropped off at Apple Tree Bay for our hike to Anchorage where the boat would pick us up. Although it was a lot colder and didn’t have as many creepy crawlies or monkeys, the national park reminded us of Tayrona National Park in Colombia. There are no roads and access to the few holiday homes and camp sites are limited to boats or hiking, so it felt really secluded. There were lots of birds in the park and on our 7km hike, we encountered two Weka’s on the paths. They looked just like ducks, but with a sharper beak and claws and fluffier feathers, a little like a Kiwi bird. The walk itself was really easy and didn’t take us long so we had some time to basque on the beach in the sun before the boat came to pick us up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fox Glacier Township&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found a deal on &lt;a href=&quot;www.bookme.co.nz&quot;&gt;bookme.nz&lt;/a&gt; for a glacier helicopter landing at Fox Glacier which is why we decided to come here rather than Franz Joseph. Frustratingly, the weather was awful in our time at Fox which meant we could not fly. Our schedule was fully booked so we could not stay another day either. The approaching paths to Fox Glacier were flooded as well which meant we had little more to do than wonder around the tiny township. I was now beginning to understand why our hostel was littered with motivational posters on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this point where we were really regretting our decision to not hire a car. Shuttle buses, we felt, were expensive for what they were ($20 per person to local treks) and transport links to Franz Joseph were also limited. Having a car would have given us the flexibility to make the most of the surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing of note that we did, besides watching a few episodes of Flight of the Conchords, was our visit to the Glow Worm Forest. As it was the only feasable walk we could do, we strolled around the forest in the day and again at night when the glow worms were visible. We weren’t expecting much so we were pleasantly surprised when we spotted the clusters of glow worms amongst the darkness. They looked like blue stars glittered around the pitch black forest. We couldn’t capture the bright sparks of light on camera so this was one for the memory bank. The Fox Glow Worm Forest was well worth the visit and it was something a little unusual from what we’d done so far. For me, it redeemed what we originally thought was a wasted trip to Fox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Nelson&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had lovely weather, despite the cool air, and Nelson was a nice place to spend a few days as we passed through. We enjoyed having Abel Tasman National Park virtually to ourselves in the winter sun, although it would definitely be a place to spend a few days in the summer when we return to New Zealand. We were gutted we never got to the top of Fox Glacier but hoped we would be able to do something similiar somewhere else on South Island.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wellington, New Zealand]]></title><description><![CDATA[“It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door.

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there’s no knowing where you might be swept off to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wellington&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey from Taupo to Wellington took the best part of the day and this wasn’t helped by the awful driver who almost ran out of fuel and struggled with the gears. The drive is through the central plateau so we drove straight past Tongariro National Park, past the mountains Mount Ruapehu and Mount Ngauruhoe and guess what?! The weather was blue skies and low winds, although we could feel the cold on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delayed and tired we arrived in Wellington around 6PM and had a 25 minute walk from the bus stop to our hostel &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.setupdixon.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Set Up on Dixon&lt;/a&gt;. The hostel was an old office building that had been converted as the kitchen was more like a staff room and there were the iconic square tiles on the ceiling. There was no lamp in the room and the ceiling light was ridiculously bright which came in useful to wake Dan up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cuba Street&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed straight out for a drink after cooking spaghetti bolognese for dinner as we only had around 36 hours in Wellingon, we wanted to make the most of it. We’d heard that Cuba Street was very hipster and full of bars. As soon as we turned the corner we were greeted with a long row of vintage shops, quirky bars, a street market and a street salsa class. We fell in love with the city immediately! After a little exploring we went in a bar called &lt;a href=&quot;www.laundry.net.nz/&quot;&gt;Laundry&lt;/a&gt;, there were old converse hanging from the ceiling, creepy barbie dolls on the lampshades and random umbrellas and mannequins around the place. Dan had a craft beer and I had a glass of wine. As it was $10-20 per drink, we had one and then headed to the liquor store and brought a bottle of wine to consume in the room whilst watching New Zealand’s version of ‘Have I Got News For You’. We hit the nightlife the second night we were in Wellington too, as the city had a higher concentration of restaurants than New York, we headed out to eat in a Vietnamese place called &lt;a href=&quot;www.restaurant88.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Restuarant 88&lt;/a&gt;, where we both had a delicious Beef Pho.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lord of the Rings Location Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This had never been on our itinerary, we had looked it up before we got to New Zealand but felt at over £100pp it was too expensive for our budget and there were other things we’d decided we’d prefer to see and do. However, after the Tongariro Crossing was cancelled, we decided to go for it so that we could see some of the other filming locations from Lord of the Rings. We managed to find tickets on &lt;a href=&quot;www.bookme.co.nz&quot;&gt;www.bookme.co.nz&lt;/a&gt;, a great website where lots of activities and trips are heavily discounted and it was booked through &lt;a href=&quot;https://roverringstours.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Rover Rings Tours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Kiwi Dave’ our guide picked us up from the i-Site in his mini van called ‘Aragorn’. We were really worried that the tour would be geared towards absolute Lord of the Rings super fans and would be given by a bigger super fan. However, as it turned out Kiwi Dave wanted to show us and talk about New Zealand just as much as he did Lord of the Rings, and it turned out we were probably the biggest Lord of the Rings geeks on the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was Mount Victoria, a lookout point over the city of Wellington. Dave pointed out where the bigger landmarks in the city were before we headed to the park to see some of the filming locations. Dave showed us a photo of the scene which was really helpful to visualise it before giving us time to have a photo there; in the park were the scenes “Shortcut to Mushrooms”, “Race to the Buckleberry Ferry” and the “Get off the Road” scene.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave then drove us to ‘Wellywood’, New Zealand’s version of Hollywood. He showed us a sign mimicking the Hollywood sign which now says Wellington after locals vandalised it, not liking the nickname ‘Wellywood’. He took us to the Roxy Cinema, owned by Peter Jackson, to see an actual Oscar Award which was won for Lord of the Rings. He also stopped outside some of the studios that have been used for films like King Kong and the Hobbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then had some time at &lt;a href=&quot;www.wetanz.com&quot;&gt;Weta Workshop&lt;/a&gt; on a guided tour around a very small part of the studio. We got to see lots of props made for films like the hobbit feet, Sting (Bilbo/Frodo’s sword), armour and a car from Halo. The guide told us about forced perspective and some of the secrets as to how Lord of the Rings was filmed to make the hobbits look smaller, there were two sizes of everything, one to make the hobbits looks small and the other characters look big. Weta Digital have just signed a deal to make four more Avatar films and the live action Mulan movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kiwi Dave drove us to a cafe for a Lord of the Rings themed lunch, by the beach on the road where Peter Jackson lives. The houses in the area sell for a couple of million dollars and mainly celebs, doctors and rich business men live there. Some of them were up in the hills and therefore they had their own private trolley lifts to get up to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon we hit loads more filming locations, we drove past the quarry used for Helms Deep and Minas Tirith, we stopped at the Hutt River which is where the Great River Anduin was filmed. We visited a rainforest in Kaitoke Regional Park where Rivendell was filmed and we went to a park where they shot scenes from Isengard.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made the tour worth every penny were the stories that Dave told us about Lord of the Rings. He had been an extra on all three films and said that his favourite actors had been the guys who played the hobbits. He told us that Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan (Merry and Pippin) had been pranksters and they had asked one of the helicopter drivers to do some stunts on their way to one of the locations, John Rhys-Davies the actor who plays Gimli was terrified and thereafter refused to get in a helicopter. He subsequently hiked up to ‘Mount Doom’ for filming. He told us Ian McKellen is scared of horses so his stunt double had to do all the scenes where he is horse riding. On the scenes where he is sat still on a horse they made a fake leg and he just stood next to it. They shot it from an angle that made it look like he was sat on the horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave also told us that Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) was a method actor so before he knew who he was he mistook him for a homeless man when he was sat opposite eating lunch. He said he didn’t eat with cutlery and still had the dirt under his fingernails. He said that he was hired after the previous actor playing Aragon had been sacked for partying too much, and this was because Peter Jackson’s wife had a crush on him. He said Viggo only took the job after his son told him it was his favourite book and that Aragon is a bad ass, prior to his son intervening he was going to turn it down. As a thank you Peter Jackson added his son as a casting crew member on the credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave told us about other little parts of the film that we would never have known otherwise. He said that Peter Jackson is renowned for retakes for luck, so in the scene where he hobbits run and roll down through the shire, Frodo’s stunt double decided to throw himself down the hill, resulting in a broken collarbone, which is why Merry pulls out a carrot in the scene and says I think I’ve broken something. He also told us that Sean Astin, the guy playing Sam turned up all ‘buff’ to play the part as he didn’t realise he was the fat hobbit. He had a 6 week diet of KFC and donuts to put on 12kg so in the early scenes of filming he isn’t in it so much, which is why he isn’t seen running in the scenes in the shire and why he just pops out from behind a tree.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave told us about some of the casting could haves which would have been disasterous. He said that initially Sean Connery auditioned for Gandalf but turned it down. The studio wanted to put Nicholas Cage in the film as Aragon but Peter Jackson said no so they made him use Liv Tyler instead. Overall, we had a great day, we got to see bits of windy Wellington and bits of the countryside around the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Te Papa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tour we got dropped off outside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/&quot;&gt;Te Papa&lt;/a&gt; which is a free museum. There was an exhibition on about New Zealand’s role in World War II and there were some huge hyper realistic sculptures of soldiers which had been produced by the Weta Workshop. We had a wander around the permanent exhibitions on about European immigration to New Zealand, Maori culture and the Whaitangi Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Those who don’t jump will never fly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leena Ahmad Almashat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taupo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey from Rotorua to Taupo was a quick one, but made longer by a 25 minute stop just outside the city, at a petrol station. We were starting to remember what the benefits of driving in New Zealand would have been very quickly. Although a city, Taupo was more the size of a bigger town in the UK. We stayed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rainbowlodge.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Rainbow Lodge&lt;/a&gt; and we were lucky enough to get a dormitory to ourselves, one of the perks of travelling in New Zealand winter. The owner was lovely, from Glasgow but he had lived in New Zealand for the last 16 years. He had a dog called Jess who was really affectionate and pinned down your arm with her paws to make sure you kept stroking her and couldn’t get away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a wander around the city on our last afternoon in Taupo and found lots of street art in the back allies which had been produced as part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=graffiti+taupo&amp;#x26;oq=graffiti+taupo&amp;#x26;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3j69i59l2.2590j0j4&amp;#x26;sourceid=chrome&amp;#x26;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;Graffiato&lt;/a&gt;. The graffiti looked new and there was barely any tagging around the city. We also went out for a meal in Taupo, as we had mainly cooked due to the well equipped kitchens and western supermarkets. We went to a curry place called &lt;a href=&quot;https://malabartaupo.com/&quot;&gt;Malabar&lt;/a&gt; and it was the most similar to the ones we have at home.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Skydive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skydiving has been on my bucketlist since I learned what it was and as we were heading to the adrenaline capital of the world, it made sense to do a skydive in New Zealand. Dan point blank refused to even entertain the idea. I booked with &lt;a href=&quot;www.skydivetaupo.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Skydive Taupo&lt;/a&gt; as it was one of the cheaper places to do it and a friend had used the same company. I tried not to work myself up before, as I knew that the skydive could be cancelled due to bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when the day came, it was partially cloudy and the limo came to pick us up on time. There were six women in total jumping the morning I did it and Dan stayed on the ground to watch. The staff took us through a safety video, made us sign to say if we die or injure ourselves it’s not their fault and then showed us the difference between the photo packages. I went with 15,000ft freefall, which meant that another person would jump with us and take pictures. In total it cost $529 (£278).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met my instructor Damo M, got suited and harnessed up before heading out to the plane. We had to sit on a bench virtually on top of one another and we were facing the back of the plane. It took around 15 minutes to reach 15000ft and at 8000ft we had to wear oxygen masks for safety reasons. As we were going up we got great views of parts of Tongariro National Park and I was able to see Mount Ruapehu poking through the clouds from the sky. Damo strapped us together and it wasn’t long before the first two people dropped out of the plane and it was my turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damo shuffled us along the bench and I sat with my legs dangling out of the plane for a few seconds. As I had to put my head back on the instructors shoulder, I couldn’t look down so after giving Sam the cameraman a nervous/terrified smile, Damo let go and we started falling out of the sky. As we tumbled down I had the lurching feeling in my stomach until we stopped tumbling and fell on our front. Then it just felt like we were floating, although we were actually falling at 125mph! What they didn’t warn us about was how cold it was, my face went numb immediately and I couldn’t catch my breath.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We freefalled for around 60 seconds and Sam took loads of photos. Considering how fast we were falling, it felt more like floating and it didn’t feel like we were pummelling to the ground. At 5000ft Damo opened the parachute and it was a slower descent to the ground. He let me help him to steer us to the ground and as there was no wind we landed pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all over so quickly! The views had been incredible over the lake but my brain had been so busy processing what had just happened, I didn’t feel I had time to enjoy it. Skydiving was an absolute adrenaline buzz and I wouldn’t hesitate to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tongariro Crossing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d booked this well in advance with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adriftnz.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Adrift&lt;/a&gt; and we were really looking forward to an 8 hour hike through the National Park to see where Peter Jackson filmed Mordor in Lord of the Rings up close. As it was winter we had to have a guide and we’d have to use crampons and an ice axe, so we knew it would be a hike that would challenge us a little more than others we had done. However, due to the bad weather it was cancelled, there were high winds, -11C temperatures and snow storms. Adrift gave us a refund and a very good reason to return to New Zealand in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Huka Falls &amp;#x26; the Great Taupo Lake&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Tongariro Crossing was cancelled we did a couple of free walks in the local area. We walked to Huka Falls and back which took around 2.5 hours. Huka Falls is a powerful waterfall and the water there was really blue.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other was the walk on the Great Lake Walkway, we headed towards Five Mile Bay but got to around three before we headed back as the weather was turning. The side of the lake had some grey sandy beaches and some hot pools of scalding water in them. There were lots of individual looking houses overlooking the lake and plenty of parks and patches of grass for walking dogs and having BBQ’s in the summer. The lake itself was massive and we hardly walked around any of it in 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We liked Taupo as a city and I absolutely loved doing a skydive. We were both pretty disappointed about the Tongariro Crossing but it has given us a reason to return to New Zealand in the future, maybe in the summer months when the weather is more reliable!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rotorua, New Zealand]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Not all those who wander are lost.” J.R.R.

&lt;p&gt;“Not all those who wander are lost.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, Lord of the Rings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had read about the eggy smell in Rotorua, and having visited Iceland, we weren’t quite expecting to be as strong as it was. So it was a bit of a shock when we stepped off the bus. It wasn’t a consistent smell, but it seemed to hit in wafts. The smell was stronger and more potent when we went for a walk around the government gardens and Rotorua lake. There were numerous spots where sulphur gas escaped the earth and bubbled up to the surface in pools of mud which was of course the source of the smell.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Hostel and Nightmare Roommate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus dropped us off a short walk from our hostel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rocksolidrotorua.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Rock Solid Backpackers&lt;/a&gt;, in the early evening. We met our two roommates as the hostel “upgraded” us from a 6 to a 4 bed dorm. The one guy, who I will call arsehole (this will become clear later) seemed to have made himself right at home as he had set up a temporary washing line for his damp clothes. He also utilised the laundry basket as a table for his laptop which he positioned right next to one of the two unoccupied beds in the middle of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been to the supermarket for supplies we returned to an incredibly hot, smelly and stuffy room. The arsehole that had took ownership of the dorm thought that turning it into a sauna was a good way of drying clothes. As he wasn’t in the room on our return, we opened the window to let some fresh air in, although this was a bit tricky as he had turned “his” window sill into a dumping ground. By doing this, we thought that at least the arsehole would then understand that he wasn’t the only person in the dorm. Clearly this didn’t work as, when we returned before bed, the window was shut and the room was even hotter than before. Soph noticed that the heater was wacked up on full so turned it off for the arsehole to immediately turn it back on again when we left the room to brush our teeth etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won’t be shocked to learn that we both had a terrible night sleep. I was fully anticipating that the arsehole was a snorer so I went to sleep with headphones in. But as my bed was less than half a metre away from his I was regularly woken up by his inconsistent snores and scoffs. Soph kept waking up covered in sweat on the top bunk, eventually gave up early in the morning and got up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day things were getting worse, after an awful night sleep our patience was wearing thin and the arsehole seemed to be doing things to deliberately irritate us. Once again he was drying his smelly socks and boxers, positioned on the heater conveniently above a sign warning against doing this due to a fire hazard. He even placed a pair of soggy boxer shorts on his locker handle which was inches away from Soph’s, meaning that to open her locker she would have to touch them. To avoid this she used a tool to knock them on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after returning to the room, he saw his underwear on the floor and muttered “for fuck sake” under his breath. He proceeded to shut the window and as soon as he did Soph asked him to leave it open due to the heat and stuffiness. He snarkily commented that as he was closest to the window he’d get cold and that the window being open yesterday meant that his plane tickets got wet so he had to go and get new tickets printed. As Soph apologised and tried to explain that the condensation was caused by him drying his washing he put his headphones on to cut her off just like a child would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tired and frustrated Soph went to reception to discuss the issues we were having with our roommate and the volunteer on reception was too scared or uncomfortable about what to do. This is despite their clear rule that drying clothes on heaters would result in a fine or ejection from the hostel. However, he absolutely knew who the “arsehole”, using his words, was as he’d also been the talk amongst the hostel staff for being an arsehole, I guess!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we decided to go back to the room to watch Netflix so that we could monitor the heat in the room to prevent a repeat of the night before. Obviously the arsehole was still there again watching Netflix. Fortunately the other roommate had checked out so I moved to the bed the other side of the room. Unfortunately, this seemed to have given the arsehole the impression that he could now do whatever he wanted to. As the evening passed we noticed that the arsehole had stashed a crate of beers in his locker. He was smashing beer after beer continuing into the early hours. Again this was a rule that the hostel covered that there was to be no drinking after 10pm. Which must have been why he hid his beers in the locker and not in the communal fridge. On reflection I don’t understand this rule because the hostel didn’t have any staff working after 10pm so how could they enforce it and who could we complain to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after we’d turned the lights off and were clearly trying to sleep, the arsehole would continue drinking and seemed to become deliberately louder. He would laugh out loud (which noone really does on their own) and make shocked noises as he watched his laptop in between farting, burping and loudly making “ahhhh” noises after sipping a, what must have been, warm beer. I loudly requested that he be quiet but he continued with the noise shortly before turning his laptop off at around 2am. Luckily, however, there was no snoring that night, probably because the air was no longer hot and stuffy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following morning, even after we explained what had happened and mentioned that the arsehole was in breach of two rules, we were the ones that had to move room. As we had barely any sleep over these two days and because of how many activities we’d crammed into our New Zealand trip, we really needed to catch up on some sleep. The receptionist only offered a 10% discount on a private room which we reluctantly took. I felt that the hostel had an obligation to do more to help us but Soph was happy enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides from the arsehole, the hostel was pretty good. I stand by opinion that they could have done more to help us, but as it’s not a party hostel, I don’t think they encounter issues like we did very often. My only other negative was that the shower cubicles share drainage which means that when the person next to you has their frothy morning piss in the shower next to you, you really know about it. And no the culprit wasn’t the arsehole I have previously mentioned, there must have been another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polynesian spa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our ongoing issues with our arsehole roommate we decided that a trip to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polynesianspa.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Polynesian Spa&lt;/a&gt; would help us relax and calm down, which it certainly helped to do. We arrived at about 4pm and spent about 2 hours dipping in and out of the adult pools. Each pool was a slightly different temperature and had different minerals which would help to alleviate various ailments. The hottest pool was 42 degrees which was the first one we went in, but we could only spend a few comfortable minutes inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our relaxation was briefly interrupted by a young asian girl having a tantrum for her mother’s benefit directly in front of the busiest pool which overlooked the bay. An older New Zealand couple next to us commented that this should be a great form of contraception to us! We knew we had chosen the adult pools for a reason and we wondered why his girl had been allowed inside, maybe it was unintentional due to the language barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the girl stormed off so we could then enjoy the beautiful sunset over Rotorua lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hobitton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not actually in Rotorua, but in the neighbouring Matamata, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hobbitontours.com/en/&quot;&gt;Hobbiton&lt;/a&gt; was my absolute favourite thing we did. We learned so many interesting facts about filming here and the attention to detail is just incredible. As an example, there is just one fake tree (you can’t tell) in Hobbiton which is the one above Bilbo’s house. Every leaf was individually attached and painted which took weeks. It was on screen in the films for a grand total of 3 seconds!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also surprised at how big the set was, there’s 44 hobbit holes surrounded by hobbit gardens and orchards as well as the Green Dragon pub. The tour took us around 2 hours to get around with stops for facts from our guide and pictures. It was amazing to see how well maintained Hobbiton was. The guide told us that to give the appearance that hobbit’s live there, part of the maintenance routine is to walk up to the washing lines so tracks are left in the grass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cheeky Nando’s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had noticed a few chains of Nando’s during our stop offs in New Zealand that we had been tempted by. So we decided to grab a cheeky Nando’s while we were here. I don’t know whether it was just this franchise in Rotorua but we had a really poor experience. I ordered my usual half a chicken in hot piri piri and Soph went for a chicken halloumi burger. Soph was given her burger first which came without halloumi. About five minutes later they brought my chips out without the chicken. Another 10 minutes had passed by the time my chicken arrived by which time I only had half a portion of cold chips left. Soph also wasn’t too happy with her burger after they swapped it for the correct one as the chicken had a rubbery texture. I doubt that we will be trying Nando’s here again. We reluctantly paid and left disappointed as true Brits would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Te Puia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tepuia.com/&quot;&gt;Te Puia&lt;/a&gt; is a geothermal valley, that also offers insights into the Maori culture. It was a 40 minute walk from the town centre and was $49.50 (£26) entrance after 10% discount from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arrivalmagazine.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Arrival magazine’s app&lt;/a&gt;. We spent an afternoon as recommended by the hostel and spent most of our time watching the active geysers. We saw a few of the geysers erupt, one reached a considerable height for a constant 10/15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also the first time we had seen the New Zealand national icon, the kiwi. Te Puia has an enclosure for their 2 kiwis which only had a dim red light for visibility and was very very dark. The kiwi is a nocturnal animal so the enclosure reverses the kiwis perception of day and night in order for visitors to see them up and about. The kiwi is a fluffy blob with large feet and a long beak to assist them on their nighttime search for food. They are a flightless bird, with no wings, and they lay eggs two thirds of their body size. They are an indangered species and native to only New Zealand so they are trying hard to preserve them from predators across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Whakarewarewa Forest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ventured over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://redwoods.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Whakarewarewa Forest&lt;/a&gt; for an afternoon. We decided against the treewalk as we thought at $25 (£13) it was quite expensive for what it was and the night time walk looked much better. Instead we walked the free Quarry lookout track which took us about an hour and a half which was enough time to appreciate the beauty of the forest. The Californian Redwood trees were absolutely huge, both wide and tall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think we normally complain but despite our grievances we still thoroughly enjoyed our time in Rotorua and will put our negative experiences down to rotten luck. I think when we look back at our time, particularly with the arsehole roommate we’ll have a good laugh about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Auckland & Paihia, New Zealand]]></title><description><![CDATA[Crossing the Pacific We flew from LAX to Auckland with  Air Tahiti Nui  and we were in Moana Economy.

&lt;p&gt;We flew from LAX to Auckland with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airtahitinui.com/nz-en&quot;&gt;Air Tahiti Nui&lt;/a&gt; and we were in Moana Economy. I was very excited about the Disney reference but it was short lived. We flew from LA to Tahiti which took almost 8 hours, the seats were upright with barely any legroom and to top it off my TV didn’t work. It was like being on a Ryanair flight for 8 hours. We then had a 4 hour stop in Tahiti airport, which you can imagine was tiny and we had none of their currency. We then had to get back on the same plane for another 5 hours to get to Auckland and because of the time difference we totally lost the 16th July (Dan’s dad’s birthday!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Auckland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we drove from the airport to Auckland Central we were instantly reminded of home. We were driving on the right (left) side of the road again, people were friendly but not eccentrically so and there were fish and chip shops everywhere. We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qsb.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Queen Street Backpackers&lt;/a&gt; in a private room so we could sleep through the jet lag. As we were so tired the first day we got there we just went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This left us with 24 hours in Auckland, a lot of the things to do in the city such as museums were pricey. We were going to walk up Mount Eden but the weather forecast was rain and it was really cloudy so we decided to catch a ferry to Devonport, a town on the other side of the water to get some good views of the city that way. It was $12 return (£6.50).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devonport was a little seaside town with a row of independent shops. We walked the streets, straight up the Mount Victoria for views over the water. We then walked to a couple of different beaches, one had houses backing onto it which were lush. All the houses had American style porches and no two were the same, they reminded us of dolls houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening we went out for a drink by the viaduct but at $20 (£11) for a beer and small glass of wine we had the one in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.parasolandswing.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Swing and Parasol&lt;/a&gt; before calling it a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Travel around NZ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had deliberated over how we were going to get around New Zealand for a really long time. The most cliche way was by motorhome and there were either self sufficient ones (that have a toilet that has to be emptied) or ones that weren’t, where we would have had to pay to camp in the camp sites for toilets and other amenities. Even though it was winter, these weren’t working out cheap and neither of us have driven anything bigger than a small car so this was the first option out of the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option we considered was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kiwiexperience.com/&quot;&gt;KiwiE bus&lt;/a&gt;. A pass to get us around both islands was working out around £400 each and we’d been told that it was easy travel. The company reserve hostel rooms, take you to the supermarket on the way and help book activities. However during our travels in South America many people referred to the KiwiE bus as ‘the big green f**k bus’; due to young backpacker’s partying, losing all sense of dignity and having sex in a shared dormitory. Again this option went out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one we nearly picked was to drive. It worked out at £350 each with insurance, we just needed to pay for fuel and parking. Driving would mean we could be flexible and probably do more as we wouldn’t be relying on public transport and we could stay in cheaper motels outside the cities. However, as it’s winter we would have been potentially driving in snow and ice and would have had to use snow chains. Also, in England, in our own cars when we are trying to navigate to a new place it mostly ends up in an argument. So for the sake of our relationship we threw out the option of driving too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This left some of the other bus companies as our only options. We looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.straytravel.com/&quot;&gt;Stray&lt;/a&gt; which was really expensive and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercity.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Intercity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakedbus.com/&quot;&gt;Naked bus&lt;/a&gt;. Naked bus mainly uses Intercity buses anyway and intercity worked out to be the cheapest option. We brought 70 hours worth of travel for £267 each and booked each of the journeys. This gave us more flexibility than booking a fixed pass of travel and we wouldn’t have the stress of driving. So we took our first bus out of Auckland and into Paihia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paihia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason we’d come further north was to see Paihia’s resident pod of dolphins. We booked the Hole in the Rock cruise through our hostel, &lt;a href=&quot;http://peppertree.co.nz/&quot;&gt;Peppertree Lodge&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greatsights.co.nz/new-zealand-tour-destinations/bay-of-islands/&quot;&gt;Great Sights&lt;/a&gt;. It cost £57. We also got discount on the room and some free WiFi; annoyingly a lot of hostels in New Zealand either charge for WiFi or give you a limited amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were lucky with the weather as it was a really sunny afternoon as we got on the boat and sailed around the bay. It wasn’t long before we were charging through the water back to where the dolphins had been spotted and we stayed and watched for around 15 minutes. The guide on the boat told us that people aren’t allowed to swim with them at the moment as there are two baby dolphins, but when they are all mature people are able to get in the water with them. The dolphins splashed around the boat, one of them kept rolling around. As the boat sped off we were lucky enough to be at the back of the boat and some of the dolphins chased the boat jumping in and out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then headed to the hole in the rock in the Bay of Islands. On the way we saw a fur seal sunbathing on a rock and, luckily, as the weather was good we were able to sail through the hole in the rock. On the way back we stopped off at Russell, a small town opposite Paihia, we had a quick walk along the waterfront before heading back to Paihia on a skipper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our second day in Paihia we hiked to Haruru Falls which was around 13km and took us around 5 hours with plenty of stops on the beach and along the way. Unlike the hikes we’d done in South America this one was easy as we didn’t have the added difficulty of being at high altitude. The walk was through forest including some mangrove forest and then along the river. The falls weren’t that impressive after Iguazú but it was a nice way to spend a sunny winters afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Auckland &amp;#x26; Paihia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly we didn’t spend long in Auckland at all as we really had just one day but as our first destination in New Zealand there was plenty there to remind us of home. Paihia was definitely a holiday destination, for kiwis and tourists, full of lodges, beaches and plenty of islands to explore. Plus, seeing the dolphins in their natural habitat was absolutely priceless!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Las Vegas, Nevada]]></title><description><![CDATA[“This isn’t the real Caesar’s Palace is it?” Alan, The Hangover MGM Grand We got to Las Vegas by the Megasbus which cost $20 for the 7 hour…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//las-vegas/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//las-vegas/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t the real Caesar’s Palace is it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan, The Hangover&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MGM Grand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to Las Vegas by the Megasbus which cost $20 for the 7 hour journey on Route 66. We arrived at around 11:30pm and were met with a queue to check in which was very much like an airport. Soph was amazed at how big the hotel was as it was her first time in Vegas and pleasantly surprised to find not one but three Starbucks inside MGM alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mananged to stay on the strip in MGM as we found a good deal on last-minute.com. It was for a room in the West Wing which many people complained about in reviews, but considering the hostels we’d slept in in South America, the West Wing was luxury. The room was also conveniently located on the strip so we only had to walk outside and we were facing New York New York, another massive hotel. That one had a rollercoaster and a ‘minature’ Empire State, Brooklyn Bridge and Statue of Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MGM Grand itself was relatively calm when we arrived on Wednesday night and Thursday. We made use of this by chilling by the pool and having a quiet drink in the hotel bar. However the crowds soon picked up the closer it got to the weekend. There seemed to be more drunk people stumbling around at 4pm on Saturday, one threw her cocktail down Soph’s leg. There were groups of people congregated next to the pool, but not in it so that they could show off their upper bodies they obviously work on for the rest of the year. Towards the closing hours of the pool area there were empty beer bottles and glasses everywhere. A very different Vegas to mid-week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MGM’s casino itself was massive and Soph mentioned how dated the decor was. From my previous visit, around 9 years ago this area didn’t appear to have changed much. Although they had removed the lion that they kept in an enclosure. The hotel was insanely big with a number of different restaurants to eat in, a Cirque dear Soliel show, a night club, comedy club, a spa and test showings of new programs but there was nothing on that we are really into. We also noticed that there were lots of families around with children, often walking through the casino after midnight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Strip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strip is absolutely huge and incredible. We spent all day walking up and down the strip hopping in and out of the casinos and shops. We walked around the canals at the Venetian, watched the fountain show outside the Bellagio to Elton John’s ‘Your Song’ and browsed the conservatory. We walked through Caesars and Planet Hollywood including their shopping centres. We were out for so long that we got to see the strip both in the day and lit up at night (which was much better). We were absolutely exhausted by the time we got back but after half a bottle of wine we went down to the casino at 01:00 to do some gambling. We only played blackjack and roulette; I lost at blackjack and Soph picked some lucky numbers on roulette so we ended up being $1 up and decided to quit whilst we were ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Downtown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited downtown in the day for breakfast, had a wander down Fremont Street and found some cool graffiti down some of the side streets. We even managed to weigh ourselves outside a restaurant that offered anyone over 350lb to ear for free in the ‘fight against anorexia’. We didn’t even come close. We then headed to the North Outlet stores where we spent around 3 hours picking up some clothes to replace those that were falling apart. In the Lyft on the way back to MGM we got talking to the driver who recommended a bar in downtown called the Griffin for cheaper drinks and good music. We thought that as it was a Friday and to fully appreciate downtown we had to return later on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a Lyft pool back to downtown later on and it’s one of the most memorable taxi journeys  we’ve taken. Our driver had to pick up  two American girls along the way, who were steaming drunk and on their way to get weed. One was a Republican and the other hated trump. The two of them went on a 20 minute rant about Trump, immigration and the orange baby blimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got back to downtown we knew that this was more our scene, there was less glamour, neon signs, cheap beer, more weirdos and trailer trash! There were bands and shows on stages, lots of people dressed up from Alan (the Hangover) to a bloke wearing a cock sling and many people holding up signs. My favourite was the 2 guys holding up a sign to kick the one in the balls. We were queuing right next to them as a woman did just that, he didn’t even flinch.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we had a good look around we found the Griffin. To my delight they served amaretto sours for $8 (mostly amaretto) and there was DJ Mike Fish in the room at the back playing an 80s, New Wave, Indie, Electro set. The drinks were great and the music was even better so we spent the rest of our night here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last stop in Vegas was the infamous sign and it was surprising how many people were queued up to take a picture with the sign. Rather than queuing we snuck to the side took our shot and headed back to the bus station for our ride to LA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soph was unsure whether she would even like Vegas but we both loved it, especially downtown. There is so much more to do there than just gambling and we could have spent days on end wandering around all the different hotels, watching shows and riding on the rollercoaster. Now that Sophs a convert we will definitely be back!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los Angeles, California]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Adventure is out there.” Ellie, Up.

&lt;p&gt;“Adventure is out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellie, Up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hollywood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to stay in Hollywood for the first few nights of our stay in Los Angeles as we had heard that the public transport was poor and we had no desire to hire a car. Getting from the airport to Hollywood was a logistical nightmare, Uber’s and Lyft’s weren’t cheap and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flylax.com/flyaway&quot;&gt;Flyaway&lt;/a&gt; bus only came once an hour. However this cost $8 (£6) per person and dropped us around ten minutes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://walkoffamehostel.com&quot;&gt;Walk of Fame&lt;/a&gt; hostel, where we were booked to stay. Eventually, half an hour late, the bus arrived, filled up and took almost two hours to get to Hollywood due to the traffic coming out of the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got off the bus and started walking the Walk of Fame to get to the hostel, the heat really hit us. We’d arrived in LA on the hottest day of the year and at 20:00 it was still 38C. The wind was even hot and felt like someone was blowing a hot hairdryer on us, it was anything but pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After checking into our 8 bed dorm, with no air con and a useless ceiling fan we went out to explore Hollywood a little. We managed to find some famous stars and some Disney Characters and we had a look around the Chinese Theatre, although we never went inside. We also saw the Hollywood sign from a shopping mall in Hollywood (from afar). We’d decided to skip the hike up to the sign due to the weather and lack of time. The sign was a little underwhelming as it’s smaller than it looks when seen on TV and it didn’t light up at night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Melrose Avenue &amp;#x26; Farmers Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching England beat Sweden 2-0 at 07:00 we had the entire day ahead of us. We decided to walk to some shops further down on Melrose Avenue, we really liked this area of Los Angeles, it had lots of quirky cafes (including a cat cafe) and was full of vintage and independent shops! There was also lots of graffiti on the buildings in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked from Melrose to the Original Farmers Market as the buses didn’t seem straightforward and there was no metro in the area; we had a look around the stalls and found some imported food such as gravy, curry sauce and Heinz baked beans which we drooled over before dragging ourselves away. We started to walk towards Beverley Hills and got to the Beverley Centre, a mall with more shops but after that our feet were killing so we got an Uber Pool back to Hollywood and had lunch in In N Out Burger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LA Galaxy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the World Cup wasn’t enough Dan booked us tickets to a soccer game, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lagalaxy.com&quot;&gt;LA Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; vs Colombus Crew, mainly as he wanted to see Zlatan Ibrahimovic. We had to get an Uber to the stadium as it would have taken hours on public transport but it was only a 40 minute car ride. We arrived really early and families were drinking and having BBQ’s in the car park before the game, we realised why when we got into the stadium where they were charging $12 (£9) for a can of beer. The stadium had a really silly ‘safety’ rule where you were only allowed clear plastic/vinyl bags into the stadium which meant I had to put my little handbag into a locker for $10 (£8).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t much of an atmosphere in the stadium compared to European football games, the pace of the game was slow and there were barely any away fans. However, being in eccentric America, every time there was an LA Galaxy goal they set off flares and fireworks and had a flashy light show to welcome the players back onto the pitch for the second half. They also used VAR to check if the ball went out of play which disallowed, what would have been, the only Colombus Crew goal. In the end the game was 4-0 to LA Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Universal Studios&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally we’d planned to visit just Disneyland Resort in California, but as LA crept closer Dan wanted to visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.universalstudioshollywood.com&quot;&gt;Universal Studios&lt;/a&gt; too. It was only one metro stop away from Hollywood and a short walk through City Walk to get there. There weren’t many big rollercoasters in the park and it seemed more to ‘show off’ Hollywood with areas like Hogsmede from Harry Potter and Springfield from The Simpsons.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the better rides we went on was the Hollywood Studio Tour. We piled into a tram and the driver took us around Hollywood Studios, which the park backs onto. He drove us around some of the sound stages, but as it was a Sunday there was no filming going on - currently they are filming the new season of Will &amp;#x26; Grace there. We were then taken around a city set which has been used multiple times to depict New York City and to the square from Back to the Future with the clock tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the rides were 3D or shows such as Waterworld and Animal Actors, which we spent some time watching so that we could watch the Harry Potter lights at 21:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anaheim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent two nights in &lt;a href=&quot;http://maingate-inn.hotels-anaheim.com&quot;&gt;Maingate Inn&lt;/a&gt; near Disney in Anaheim so that we would get a full day at &lt;a href=&quot;https://disneyland.disney.go.com&quot;&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;, early in and a late night. From Hollywood, we took a Lyft to Anaheim as it worked out the same price as two metro and train tickets and it was much quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motel was a typical American ‘Bates Motel’ complete with a cockroach in the room and we ordered a Chinese takeaway for dinner. The motel was literally around the corner from Disney so we had a fireworks preview the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially we had paid $89 (£68) for park entrance to one of the Disney Parks in the resort; there was both Disney Park and Disney Adventure. It was an extra $50 (£38) for a park hopper ticket meaning we could go between the two parks during the day. When we got there at 08:00 and realised the park was open to midnight, we decided to upgrade as there was a Pixar Fest going on in Disney Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be a great decision. The main Disney Park had a much smaller castle than both Paris and Orlando and all of the classic rides; Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, It’s a Small World. It didn’t take us long to hit most of those with Fastpass before we switched parks to Disney Adventure. This one was different to Paris and Orlando as it had a huge Pier, with a wheel and was very pixar orientated; with a Bugs Life and Cars section. There was also a new rollercoaster called the Incredicoaster which had sounds in the headrest from Incredibles 2; it was so good we went on it twice. The Hollywood Tower of Terror had also been revamped in this park and was Guardians of the Galaxy themed; Rocket cuts the wires to the lift as he’s trying to rescue the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to meet a few characters throughout the day too, including Scully and Mike from Monsters Inc, Dug from Up and Edna and Frozone from the Incredibles. We managed to do everything we wanted in the parks by 21:00 and headed to the castle to watch the pixar firework display. Sadly, because the castle was so small it made it hard to see the projection, but they had a flying Buzz Lightyear and the balloon from Up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Santa Monica &amp;#x26; Venice Beach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned to Los Angeles after our three day trip to Vegas and stayed in New Downtown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://freehandhotels.com/los-angeles/&quot;&gt;Freehand Hostel&lt;/a&gt; which was probably the nicest hostel we have ever stayed in. It was an old building and reminded us of the hotel in American Horror Story with a 13th floor and a rooftop bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the metro to Santa Monica Pier, which took just under an hour from 7th Street. On our last day in America we decided to soak up the sunshine and walk from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Canals, which took around an hour. We walked the Venice Boardwalk, past Muscle Beach and what hit us was the overwhelming amount of homeless people that congregated there. We’d been told before we even left to stay in Santa Monica as its the nicest (and most expensive) part of L.A. but we preferred the other areas we had visited. The homeless lined up the beach side of the boardwalk selling all sorts from great pieces of art, conspiracy theories and $1 for a ‘shit piece of advice’. The canals themselves were pretty and the houses around them looked ridiculously expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Los Angeles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d been told that Los Angeles is a ‘dump’ and warned that it wasn’t worth our time, but we really liked the city, minus the heat.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Panama City, Panama]]></title><description><![CDATA[La casa de Nick y Charlotte In the end we spent ten days in Panama City as we were staying with friends.

&lt;p&gt;In the end we spent ten days in Panama City as we were staying with friends. Originally we’d had plans to visit Bocas Del Toro and Boquete in the North of Panama for around five days but changed our minds due to tiredness and the weather. We’d arrived in Panama City during rainy season and unlike rainy season in the Amazon or on the Caribbean coast it was much more gloomy, grey skies for most of the day and heavy rain in the afternoon. Instead, we thought we’d spent ten days relaxing and really exploring Panama City as the most we’d spent in one place up until now was four or five days. For most of our time we stayed in Nick and Charlotte’s flat which was on Avenida Balbao and their balcony had a brilliant view of the skyscrapers in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did lots of ‘normal’ things in Panama City, such as shopping in the malls, we got haircuts and a manicure (me, not Dan), we went to the cinema twice, to see Incredibles 2 and Jurassic World 2, we went bowling and spent time in the bars watching the World Cup. Really we made the most of our time charging our batteries and eating homecooked food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Casco Viejo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited the old town in Panama City a number of times, mainly as there were some cool bars and restaurants. We went for brunch one Saturday and returned the following day to watch the England vs Panama game. In Panama time this was on at 07:00 so we were up at 05:45, necked Espresso Martini’s before we left and were pretty drunk by 11:00. We watched the match in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294480-d2694608-Reviews-La_Rana_Dorada-Panama_City_Panama_Province.html&quot;&gt;La Rana Dorada&lt;/a&gt; and then went for breakfast in &lt;a href=&quot;http://casabruja.com/&quot;&gt;Casa Bruja&lt;/a&gt; for more craft beers and a civilised game of ‘What do you Meme?‘. The Panama fans were brilliant sports, considering we were surrounded by them. The loudest cheer of the game was when they scored, everyone in the bar was on their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan and I also went back to Casco Viejo in the day to have a look around. Unlike other old towns, such as Cartagena, Casco Viejo had a lot of restoration work going on. As we walked the narrow streets, many of the buildings were deralict or being supported by scaffolding. There were a few souvenir shops and some hat shops filled with the stereotypical Panamanian hat. We visited some of the plaza’s in the area; Plaza de la Independencia, Plaza de Francia and Plaza Boliviar. Unlike many other Latin American cities that we had visited, there wasn’t a free walking tour around the area so we were left to wander around and explore on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Multiplaza&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited a couple of malls in Panama City, as it’s much more Americanised and Western than the rest of Latin America. We were able to start replacing some of the clothes we’d been wearing and washing continuously for the last four months in Forever 21, Bershka, Pull &amp;#x26; Bear and Zara. It was there we decided to go to the cinema a couple of times, which was really cheap in comparison to the UK, $6 (£4.52) for a ticket and $3 for a big tub of popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our favourite supermarket in Panama was Riba Smith, it was full of western food. It reminded us of a Waitrose and we were able to find all our favourites in there; nice cereal, gravy, mustard, craft beers, baked beans and the most expensive fruit and vegetables that we’d ever seen; $6 (£4.52) for a cauliflower. Riba Smith made it really easy for us to make lots of home cooked meals, something we’d struggled to do since we left Chile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were in Panama City for such a long period of time, a visit to the Panama Canal was a must. It cost $15 (£11.30) to get in, which was pretty steep compared to what we were used to paying. We watched a film about the canal and wandered around the museum that explained how the canal was built and how it has developed over the last 100 years. Unfortunately we’d arrived really early and had to wait a couple of hours to see a boat pass through the canal. At around 15:00 one finally arrived and we watched the water empty out and a big ship full of containers pass through from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It took a really long time to get it through. Afterwards we thought we would head to Albrook Mally, but the taxi tried to charge us $10 as we were tourists, so instead we caught the local bus for 25c each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Metropolitan Natural Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we still hadn’t had enough of the jungle, we decided to hike around the Metropolitan Natural Park. To follow all of the paths took around three hours but it took us a little longer as we lingered around some of the spots and walked slowly looking for wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw a number of colourful and hairy caterpiller’s so we were careful holding onto the handrails and trees. There were some turtles in one of the ponds and we saw two toucan’s but they were too quick to snap a photo of. The highlight of the day was the massive sloth that we spotted moving around in the tree’s. Considering they have a reputation for being slow, he was moving through the tree’s pretty quickly. There were also supposed to be two types of monkeys in the park; howler monkeys and mono titi but they never made an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cinta Costera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One afternoon after the football, we had a wander down Cinta Costera. We walked up a little from the ‘Panama’ sign for views of the huge skyscrapers against the sea. We then walked from there to Casco Viejo, which meant passing through the fish market. This was my favourite view of the city; the old fishing boats and market, in front of the huge new modern glass skyscrapers and the old town behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Panama City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panama was just what we needed after a full on four months in South America. It was great to see Nick and Char and do things we hadn’t been able to do since we left the UK, such as cook meals from scratch, go to the cinema, get hair cuts and do some shopping that wasn’t in a market full of nick naks!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[San Blas Islands, Panama]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Paradise is not a place, its a state of mind.” Frank Sonnerberg San Blas We booked our trip to San Blas through  San Blas Dreams  for $15…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//san-blas-islands/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//san-blas-islands/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jul 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Paradise is not a place, its a state of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Sonnerberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;San Blas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked our trip to San Blas through &lt;a href=&quot;www.sanblasdreams.com&quot;&gt;San Blas Dreams&lt;/a&gt; for $152 (£115) with a private cabin. We decided to go for just one night as we were worried we’d have terrible weather as it was rainy season. We also had the option of a late check out on the second day for an extra $20 (£15) meaning we would leave the islands at 15:00 so could make two full days of it if we wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were picked up from &lt;a href=&quot;www.mamallena.com&quot;&gt;Mamallena Hostel&lt;/a&gt; at 05:30 in the morning in a 4x4, we had a quick stop at a Rey supermarket to get water and snacks before driving to the Caribbean coast. The second half of the journey was on a winding road through the jungle to the port owned by the Guna people. We paid $22 (£16.60) tourist tax and waited for a boat to Chichime Island, nicknamed Paradise Island, where we would be staying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sky was a little grey so we were worried about the weather as we made our way to the island, which took a little over an hour. However, once we arrived, the sky cleared up and we had sun and blue skies for the rest of the day. San Blas was idyllic, there were lots and lots of islands made up of white sand, blue sea and palm trees dotted all through the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cabin we were staying in was really basic, basically a bamboo shack on the beach, with tarpulin to keep the rain out and a double bed with a mosquito net. The floor was sandy and full of crab holes so we had to watch where we walked, especially at night. We were told that there was only fish as a meal option on the island so we had eggs for all of our meals instead, our stay was very basic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chilled on the beach until 14:00 when we had a tour of the islands; firstly we headed to a natural aquarium in the sea, some shallow water near the reefs where we could snorkel. Apart from some small transparent fish, we saw some starfish, a sand dollar and a sting ray. The ray swam quickly across the shallow water and no one was ready with their snorkelling mask on, but we saw its shadow from above.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we headed to Fragata Island, where we could walk from one island to another. The second island was really small and it took a few minutes to walk around it. As it was only inhabited by crabs we had to watch where we stood as we had a wander round. Finally, we headed to Perro Island which was idyllic, a gorgeous beach with a small bar and a swing. There was also a shipwreck just off shore which we could snorkel around. As we’d only hired one snorkel and mask Dan went first but put me off telling me it was really deep, dark and he’d seen three jellyfish. There were lots of fish to spot and the shipwreck was really cool to swim around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Green is the prime color of the world, and that from which its loveliness arises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedro Calderon de la Barca&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El Valle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it was the end of term for Nick and Char and they were heading back to the UK on the 4th July, Dan and I booked to stay in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mamallena.com/&quot;&gt;Mamallena Hostel&lt;/a&gt; in Panama City for our last few days there. Mamallena wasn’t in a very nice area of Panama and the style of the hostel made it feel more like we were by the coast than in the middle of a bustling city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to go to El Valle for a couple of nights and caught the bus for $4.25 (£3.22). Nick and Char decided to join us for a night as we’d decided to do a hike they hadn’t yet done . It took 2.5 hours to get there from the city and we were plesantly suprised as to how quiet and green it was; El Valle turned out to be a beautiful town in the middle of a dormant volcano crater. We stayed the first night in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bodhihostels.com&quot;&gt;Bodhi Hostel&lt;/a&gt; with Nick and Char and made the most of the hostels pancake breakfast and delicious smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El Serpentario&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had planned to rent bikes and go to a waterfall nearby but as the weather was threatening to rain, after having a look around the local market we headed to the Snake Zoo rescue centre. This was only around a 20 minute walk from the hostel and cost $3 to enter. It wasn’t a very big rescue centre, with a few caiman, turtles and a lot of snakes. The guide told us that sometimes they have rescued sloths there too but at that time they didn’t. He showed us some of the different types of snakes and showed us two vipers, fer-de-lance, the most deadly snake and the most common in Panama. The guide let us hold a rainbow snake which they call Lola and have as a ‘pet’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;La India Dormida&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d planned to do the hike up to La India Dormida which we had been told would take a few hours and was pretty steep. We set off at 08:00, so that we had a better chance of good weather and so that Nick and Char could head back to Panama City.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hill has the name La India Dormida as the crater is shaped like a sleeping woman. The hike up wasn’t so bad and took around an hour; it was slippy on the rocks and the wet clay, mostly we were lucky that there wasn’t heavy rain as it would have made the walk down much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view from the summit was stunning, we could see all of El Valle and surrounding valleys. We spent some time up on the rocks near a sheer drop and walked around the ridge of the old dormant volcano, before heading back down.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Casa Mariposa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people had recommended staying the night at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.casamariposaelvalle.com&quot;&gt;Casa Mariposa&lt;/a&gt;, a gueshouse owned by Ursula and Harry, a Swiss lady and a guy from Colombia. They have two rescued sloths that live in their house which guests can interact with during their stay. A year ago the two sloths had a baby, who also now lives with them. It cost us $55 for the night plus tax, so wasn’t the cheapest place we had stayed but it was worth every cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the La India Dormida hike, the heavens opened and it didn’t stop raining until the following day. Harry told us that the sloths are more sleepy when it rains but he would fetch us should they wake up. At around 17:00, he told us he had fed them but they hadn’t really got up but said we could come and have a look anyway. Luckily, the baby sloth was curious and came out from behind the sofa to see what was going on. Harry told us we could feed her some flowers, which was the equivalent of chocolate to sloths. He told us that the ropes and branches extend throughout their house so the sloths can go whereever they like. He showed us some bells on the doorhandles and told us that the mother sloth was really clever and had worked out how to open the doors, so they have had to put bells on them so they can hear at night if she tries to get outside.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we got up early, hoping that the sloths would get up in the morning sun and to make sure we caught a bus back to the city early enough to get back in time for the England vs Colombia game. Harry brought the baby and father sloth out and said that they needed to use the toilet, which they only do once a week. He put them in the trees, they climbed down and hid in the bushes for privacy to use the toilet. We fed them more flowers on the branches before they started to make their way back inside. We were surprised by how soft their fur was as it looks really course and how gentle and clever they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on El Valle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We loved El Valle, it was quiet and lush green. Sadly, we had terrible thunderstorms just after we had finished the La India Dormida hike which meant that we weren’t able to expore the local countryside any further. However, we would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Panama to make some time for El Valle and to spend at least one night at Casa Mariposa.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[San Andrés Island, Colombia]]></title><description><![CDATA[“The worlds finest wilderness lies beneath the waves.” Robert Wayland.

&lt;p&gt;“The worlds finest wilderness lies beneath the waves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Wayland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting there&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We flew to San Andrés Island with Viva Air from Cartagena. Although it’s a Colombian Island, San Andrés is located closer to Nicaragua than Colombia. We had to prove we had a flight off the island and out of Colombia in order to board the plane. And, as San Andrés is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, called “Seaflower Biosphere Reserve”, we had to pay 106,000COP (£28) each just to enter the island. We’d met a Dutch restuarant owner in Cartagena who had visted San Andrés whilst we were in Santa Marta. When we went back to his restaurant, he told us that the weather had been bad as it was the start of rainy season and he told us that there are lots of police on the island as it used to be linked with narco trafficking. He was right about the police, but wrong about the weather. We were lucky to have blazing hot sun every day but one that we were on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;El Centro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t do a lot in the time we spent on San Andrés Island other than napping on the beach, drinking and watching the World Cup. There was a beautiful beach in El Centro called Sprat Bight. It had white sand, ridiculously blue sea and a great view of Johnny Cay island. The planes leaving the island took off over the beach which was so loud as they were so low, it kept making us jump!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Andrés itself seemed to be a holiday destination for Colombians rather than a backpacker destination. There were lots of all inclusive hotels with pools and barely any hostels and decent restuarants. We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/co/the-rock-house.en-gb.html?aid=356980;label=gog235jc-hotel-XX-co-theNrockNhouse-unspec-pa-com-L%3Aen-O%3Aabn-B%3Achrome-N%3AXX-S%3Abo-U%3AXX-H%3As;sid=da2dd76ee5eb7f3a339f6e484605414c;dist=0&amp;#x26;group_adults=2&amp;#x26;sb_price_type=total&amp;#x26;type=total&amp;#x26;&quot;&gt;Rock House Hostel&lt;/a&gt; which was outside the centre in Barrio Cabanas. It was built up a cliff face that was full of iguanas and the hostel owner had two very cute dogs! El Centro was full of duty free shops depite lacking in restaurants, although we didn’t really find the prices any cheaper than elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centre also had a typical ‘I love San Andrés’ sign which was always busy with tourists. There were also statues of Captain Morgan, a pirate thought to have made his base on the island, stealing gold from Spanish ships passing through the Carribean during the time of the Spanish conquest. People believe that the gold is still buried somewhere on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we really wanted to do was rent a golf buggy and drive around the island. We’d read that it takes around 3 hours to get around the whole of San Andrés island and there were numerous things to see, the oldest church, a blow hole, some other more secluded beaches and a lake. However, we knew it would be a recipe for disaster, trying to drive and navigate on the wrong side of the road so we opted for a day trip out to some of the smaller islands instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Snorkelling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Greeno’s penultimate day we did a snorkelling trip around the coral reefs. We found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g3493965-d10840302-Reviews-Caribe_Extremo-San_Andres_San_Andres_Island_San_Andres_and_Providencia_Departme.html&quot;&gt;Caribe Extremo&lt;/a&gt; owned by Fernando on Trip Advisor, he had really great reviews and would only take out groups of 2-4 people for £18 each. We met him at 09:00, he gave us good snorkelling gear and took us out from the island around ten minutes away, we were the only ones by that part of the reef. The sea was really shallow and it didn’t take long before we saw two big eagle rays swimming just off the reef. In the hour we were swimming we saw three more eagle rays, two sting rays, a lobster, a crab, an octopus, lots of colourful fish and coral! The boys were able to hold their breath and go under water trying to get closer to the marine life for a good picture.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Johnny Cay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnny Cay is an island just off the coast of San Andrés. For £7 we took a boat to see a rusty ship stuck on the coral, stopping at Rose Cay, Haynes Cay and Johnny Cay. On Rose Cay we were able to snorkel in the natural aquarium. The water was shallow and warm but it was so busy compared to the snorkelling trip we had taken the day before and there were just a few colourful fish to see. However, we were able to walk through the sea between Rose Cay and Haynes Cay, walking from one island to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boat then took us to Johnny Cay, which was beautiful; white sand and blue sea. The island was around 1KM in width and home to over 1000 iguanas. We walked around the island where we saw loads of iguanas, one was absolutely massive! We also saw some big crabs and some little hermit crabs. After that we found a spot of shade away from the busier part of the beach and settled down for a chilled out afternoon and I finally got my Pina Colada in a coconut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on San Andrés Island&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of food options, we absolutely loved chilling out on San Andrés and could easily have spent another week there. Johnny Cay was the best beach we visited in South America and it was great to finally have some time to nap on the beach!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Santa Marta & Palomino, Colombia]]></title><description><![CDATA[“One’s destination is never a place, but always a new way of seeing things.” Henry Miller.

&lt;p&gt;“One’s destination is never a place, but always a new way of seeing things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Miller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Santa Marta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the pleasant surprise of Cartagena, Santa Marta was a bit of a let down. We were warned that many Venezuelan refugees had fled to Santa Marta and we’d been told to watch out at ATMs. Apart from a Cathedral, a library dedicated to Gabriel Garcia Marquez and a street full of bars and restaurants there was nothing else to really see in the oldest city in Colombia. It seemed that mainly Colombian tourists visited the resort of Rodereo and backpackers used Santa Marta as a hub to neighbouring attractions, luckily we didn’t hang around for long.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tayrona National Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikitravel.org/en/Tayrona_National_Park&quot;&gt;National Park&lt;/a&gt; for one night rather than two as accommodation options were limited. We could either camp in a boiling hot tent or sleep in a hammock where mosquitoes would have free reign, so we went with the tent. We got a bus from Santa Marta for $7000COP (£1.77) to the entrance of the park, paid the $54,000COP (£13.64) entrance fee to get in and hiked the hour and a half in the boiling heat to get to the campsite we’d picked. Within minutes we were dripping with sweat, Tayrona National Park was one of the hottest places we’d been, even more so than the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dropping off our bags we headed to San Juan beach. It wasn’t as big as we thought it would be but there was white sand and blue sea. As we tried to find a place under the palms in the shade we saw an iguana running across the beach and noticed a swampy lake with warnings that there are caiman living there.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had wanted to hike to El Pueblito, an indigenous village where people from the Kogi tribe live, especially as we weren’t going to do the Los City Trek. It’s around a two hour hike from San Juan, but by the time we’d got there from our campsite we were wiped and decided to nap in the shade instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campsite we stayed in was really basic, tents with a foam mattress, showers with a hose pipe, no WiFi and toilets with no toilet seat. We had an early night knowing the heat would wake up us the next morning. Around 5:00AM we woke up to the sound of howler monkeys in the forest nearby. After they left we managed to get another couple of hours sleep in before the sun got too hot and we had to evacuate the tents.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d decided to go back to the closest beach for the morning before the hike back and the sweaty bus back to Santa Marta. However, on our way we saw some cotton-top tamarin monkeys. They completely surrounded us squeaking and jumping from tree to tree. The brave ones stuck around and checking us out by peering around the tree trunks. After this we continued on what we thought was the way to the beach but we’d took a wrong turn and ended up walking an hour in the wrong direction to the exit. We stayed for breakfast and then hiked 2.5 hours back to the bus stop, absolutely drenched in sweat!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Palomino&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palomino is only two hours from Santa Marta so we decided to spend one night in the little village in the hunt of some more beach time. When we arrived it was literally shacks and dirt roads with lots of hostels (and hippies). We spent the rest of the day by the pool with the plan of hitting the beach the next day. Palomino beach had a few bars and hotels but it went on for miles and miles and was much more secluded than we thought it would be. We had a stroll along it in the morning but it was sadly, a little disappointing. The sea was also so rough, that it wasn’t possible to take a dip, so as we were melting from the heat, we headed back to the hostel to use the pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Dreamer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked two nights at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedreamerhostel.com/en/&quot;&gt;The Dreamer&lt;/a&gt;, a hostel just outside of town in Santa Marta, as we felt we needed some time to chill out in one place. The hostel had a pool, a restaurant, TV’s with the World Cup on and we had a pool volleyball competition. One of the nights we were there we finally had a Salsa lesson; we struggled to master even the basics but luckily Dan didn’t tread on my toes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Santa Marta &amp;#x26; Palomino&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending some time in the beautiful city of Cartagena, Santa Marta and Palomino really didn’t compare. However, we loved Tayrona National Park and if it wasn’t for sleeping in a sweaty tent we would definitely have spent more time there!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cartagena, Colombia]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did.

&lt;p&gt;“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines, sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in you sail. Explore. Dream. Discover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Old Town&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our first day in Cartagena, after a much needed long lie in, in a room with air con and no windows, we went on a wander around the city’s streets. We headed straight to old town; this part of the city is surrounded by walls with narrow cobbled streets and old colourful houses. It felt very touristy compared to anywhere else we had been in Colombia. We found a quirky coffee shop in a library with a huge courtyard out back and had iced hot chocolate and lemonades which were very refreshing in the intense Caribbean Coast heat. Later in the afternoon we did a walking tour in old town and the guide told us lots of dates, facts and figures about Cartagena as we walked along the streets and  walls of the old city. It was reminiscent of a walled European city like Dubrovnik or Kotor but more colourful and much hotter!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide told us about the meanings of the different door knockers on the old town doors, hands are for religious men or women and lizards mean wealth. He also showed us the Cathedral and talked a lot about the history of the African slaves that were sold and traded in the area. He also talked about the indigineous people in the area; that some of them come into the city to sell fruit. Luckily the rain held off for the length of the tour and afterwards we hit &lt;a href=&quot;http://collagecharladero.com/&quot;&gt;Collage Charaldero&lt;/a&gt; for the cheapest two for one Mojitos we could find in old town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getsemini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were staying in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hostalcaracoles.net/&quot;&gt;Hostal Caracoles&lt;/a&gt; just between the Old Town and Getsemini. When we arrived the streets didn’t look like much at all, it didn’t help that the absolutely crazy taxi driver had no idea where he was going, couldn’t read a map and thought it was acceptable to drive between two cars on a two lane road to overtake. We actually feared for our lives. To annoy us even further he tried to take a tip when we paid with a 20.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getsemini turned out to be our favourite part of the city, mostly at night! There were colourful flags decorating some of the streets and the buildings were old and crumbling housing cocktail bars and hipster type restaurants. Holy Trinity Square came alive at night as people brought beers from the nearby shop and drank on the square whilst watching the street entertainment. One night we watched a guy impersonating Shakira which was so awful it was great and another evening watched refugee from Venezuela play his violin; he was amazing! We also went to an Indonesian restuarant called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297476-d4305957-Reviews-Saint_Roque_Restaurante_Cafe-Cartagena_Cartagena_District_Bolivar_Department.html&quot;&gt;Saint Roque Restuarant&lt;/a&gt;, we ate there twice. The owner was really friendly, the food was delicious and the profits went to schooling poor children in Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After partying in Medellin, we decided to do the same in Cartagena, on Izzy’s penultimate night. However no matter where we went, bars on the squares, by the coast in the old town, everywhere seemed dead! We guessed this was because it was a Thursday as it was much busier on the Friday! Either way we still had a great time and a good send off for Izzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Isla Baru&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we got to Cartagena we’d done some research and heard that it wasn’t as beach-y as people expect and that trips to the Rosario Islands were where the beaches could be found. However we read blog after blog of people’s bad experiences being crammed in speedboats, forced to visit an aquarium and ending up with an hour at a nice beach. So instead we decided to visit an island ourselves and spend the night, maximising beach time. We went with Isla Baru and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportbaru.com/&quot;&gt;Aura Hotel Baru&lt;/a&gt; which was the cheapest we could find but it was definitely still well out of budget. We had found cheaper places to stay in Playa Blanca but we read lots of reviews about rats running over peoples beds and thought we’d give that a miss.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hopped on a private speedboat to the hotel first thing in the morning and the ride wasn’t too bumpy. After checking in we had two hours on Agua Azul, a beautiful white sand and blue sea beach, where the water was warm! There weren’t too many sellers to irritate us and barely any other tourists so it was lush! The hotels ‘beach’ was more man made but it was still a nice change to snooze on the sun beds as we hadn’t done that since Brazil. After making the most of the sun we headed back to Cartagena the next afternoon feeling very refreshed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Cartagena&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartagena was one of our favourite cities in Colombia, although the most pricey. It was definitely set up for tourism; the old town had been restored and was really chic and clean whilst Getsemini was more rustic and a great place to drink in the bars and clubs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Medellin, Colombia]]></title><description><![CDATA[“My plan is to dance until everything is solved.” Anonymous.

&lt;p&gt;“My plan is to dance until everything is solved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One hell of a bus journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were concerned about getting on another Colombian bus after our trip to Salento but we’d been told that the road to Medellin was much straighter, taking around 7 hours on the bus service &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flotaoccidental.com/en/&quot;&gt;Flota Occidental&lt;/a&gt; directly from Salento. Again it only cost $47000COP (£12) and at 11AM after a big brunch we boarded the little minivan and headed out of Salento. The first warning sign of things to come was that there were no seatbelts and poor air conditioning. A couple of hours into winding round the countryside we realised the roads were going to be exactly the same as the ride from Bogotá to Salento. The only difference was it was now daylight so we were able to see how absolutely mental the driver was, going full speed around corners, overtaking on corners, stalling on every hill start and generally being completely wreckless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the rain in Colombia there were a number of landslides on the road meaning there were road works causing lots of traffic. At one point we saw a car on the other side of the road slam straight into a cow that had wandered into the road. We stopped around four hours into our journey so our driver could catch the second half of the Colombia vs Egypt match and enjoy his beer with his late lunch! Nine hours after we set off, with only one toilet stop, we arrived in Medellin; absolutely knackered, starving and incredibly dehydrated as we hadn’t dared to drink anything. We brought some beers and water from the bus station (essential supplies) and headed to our Airbnb with a takeaway pizza in mind and a good nights sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Downtown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d been looking forward to exploring Colombia since the beginning of our trip but sadly in the back of our minds was the stigma attached to the country, that is that it’s dangerous. Particularly Medellin, the once murder capital of the world! We explored downtown with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realcitytours.com/barrio-transformation-tour/&quot;&gt;Real City&lt;/a&gt; free walking tour on our first day to see what the Medellin was actually like. We were eager to learn about the country’s 54 year conflict and what it had been like living in Medellin, but sadly the tour didn’t live up to our expectations. The guide barely mentioned Colombia’s recent history and it felt like she was ignoring the elephant in the room, which we found really irritating. Instead she showed us where we could shop for fake goods, pointed out the prostitutes that work near the church so that men can repent their sins straight after the deed and we saw some breakdancers who were really amazing dancing to J Balvin, ‘Mi Gente’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the guide didn’t go into masses of detail about the the political and economical conflict between the guerillas, paramilitary groups and cartels, she did emotionlessly point out a couple of places in the city that had been affected by violence. She walked past a balcony at the metro station where a grenade had been dropped killing lots of people and she also showed us Plaza de San Antonio, which contains two bird sculptures by Botero, one of which had been blown up in 1995 during a music concert killing 30 people and injuring 200. The guide talked a lot about the transformation of the city quite desperately and explained that Colombians are happy people because they forget what had happened to them in the past, and look to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of Medellin being dangerous, there were obviously places that we wouldn’t have wandered around during the night but it didn’t feel dangerous at all and was like any other South American city. The only difference was that people in the streets would say “Hola Gringo!” and wave; the guide told us not to take this offensively as people in Medellin are happy to see tourists and that’s why they stare and say hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pablo Escobar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we had left the UK, a Pablo Escobar tour in Medellin wasn’t even up for debate it was a must! However we changed our minds very quickly once we arrived in Colombia. One reason was cost, a Pablo Escobar tour would set us back between £40-150 to see where he used to live, his grave, where he imprisoned himself and the roof where he was killed. Some of the reviews also said that the guides really glorify him, ignoring the fact that he murdered hundreds of innocent people with his acts of terror; we were uncomfortable enough seeing people selling caps and tshirts with his face on them around Colombia. In Bogotá, the walking tour guide had rightly referred to Escobar as a terrorist and talked about Colombians being unhappy that he is glorified as a protagonist in the Netflix series ‘Narcos’. The guide told us that she had met some backpackers who had been to Medellin and told her that they had paid a lot of money for a city tour from John Jairo Velásquez (or Popeye) Escobars hitman. She said they’d been excited about it, until she’d asked them why they were so excited about being shown around by a serial killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we did the walking tour in Medellin, it became evident that some Paisas (people from Medellin) aren’t ready/willing to talk in detail about the violence in their country. We had planned to ask the guide how we could learn more about Escobar without doing anything insensitive but just the question seemed insensitive when she hadn’t even addressed Escobar by name; in the end we didn’t bother and decided to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://medellin.travel/MedellinTravelWeb/locations/101/house-of-memory-museum?lang=en&quot;&gt;Museo Casa de la Memoria&lt;/a&gt; which she recommended to learn more about the Colombian conflict and its victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Museo Casa de la Memoria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Museo Casa de la Memoria turned out to be very interactive and we were able to download an app to follow around the museum. Sadly most of the interactive stuff was in Spanish but there was free WiFi to help translate! It wasn’t a bad way to spend a few hours for free, looking at photos and newspaper articles about FARC, ELN and Narco Terrorism. The most hard hitting part were the big TV’s where victims told their stories about being displaced and terrorised during the conflict, these had subtitles in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the museum was good, it still didn’t seem to satisfy our thirst for information about the history of the country. Something was missing, to us it felt like Medellin doesn’t want to accept its past, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://colombiareports.com/medellin-needs-pablo-escobar-museum/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; really sums up how we felt about the lack of information for tourists to really understand what Colombians have been through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Atlético National vs Atlético Huila (written by Dan)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greeno and I jumped in an Uber to the Atanasio Girardot Stadium to watch Atlético National vs Atlético Huila in the second leg of the play off semi final. We had bought the tickets from a restaurant on the advice of the tour guide for $76000COP (£20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived we were immediately flagged down outside a bar so we stopped for a few beers and to soak up the atmosphere amongst the locals. In between being offered fake shirts, cigarettes and everything else we noticed a group of lads drinking beers and snacking on large bowls of fruit. On reflection this probably explains the lack of obese fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following our struggle trying to find the right entrance we eventually made it inside just before kick off. Having been advised previously to not sit in the south end we could see why. The fans were bouncing and singing all game, which I’m sure would have been an experience, but probably not if you wanted to watch the game. We were on the lookout for players we recognised but it wasn’t until Zuniga, formerly of Watford, who was subbed on that we had found one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the final score was 0-0, for a goalless draw it was pretty exciting and the quality of football was better than we expected. We lost count of the number of times the woodwork was hit and, but for the crossbar, we almost saw a 35 yard free kick fly into the top corner for Huila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first leg also finished 0-0 this meant that the game went to penalties which was probably the best Huila were hoping for, as the game panned out particularly after they had a man sent off. Nacional had the clear advantage as the penalties were taken right in front of the boisterous south stand fans and they subsequently won 4-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Nacional they didn’t go on to win the competition as they were beaten by Deportes Tolima in the final on penalties. Even though Nacional finished top of the table, in the Colombian Primera division, the top 8 teams at the end of the season enter into a play off tournament to determine the winner. I would definitely say they will feel hard done by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El Poblado&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the night life area in Medellin, where all of the bars, lots of restaurants and most of the hostels are. However it was much pricier than anywhere else we had been in Colombia! We went there on two nights that we stayed in the city, the first for some beers and mojitos and the second we ended up in a reggaeton club called &lt;a href=&quot;https://vintrash.co/&quot;&gt;Vintrash&lt;/a&gt; after a massive jug of spiced rum sangria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Guatapé&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a day trip to Guatapé with a private driver arranged through the Airbnb we were staying at as it worked out cheaper than a tour. We stopped at El Peñón de Guatapé first, a massive rock with over 700 steps to climb for fantastic views of the lake. What we hadn’t anticipated was that it was Colombian bank holiday Sunday, it was sunny  and the place was absolutely rammed! However we had some mango biche and some tinnies at the top before queuing to come back down.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ate in a restaurant on the plaza and Iz and I had Banjeras Paisa, a typical dish from the Antioque region of Colombia. It’s a tray full of food; chorizo, fried pork belly, mince, rice, beans, fried egg, fried plantain, avocado, arepas and a token bit of salad. Absolute workers dinner and very filling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Medellin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We liked Medellin, but felt that the city didn’t really know how to handle its growing tourism, not wishing to address Escobar who is sadly a huge part of their history. The city of Medellin is somewhere we would like to visit again to see how it changes and we’d definitely spend longer there. Some of the graffiti we drove past around the city was probably some of the best we’d seen in South America and had we been there another day we definitely would have done the graffiti tour in Communa 13. However, it was time to head to the sunshine and the islands on the Caribbean coast!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Salento, Colombia]]></title><description><![CDATA[“What matters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it.” Gabriel García Márquez Transport…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//salento/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//salento/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What matters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel García Márquez&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transport &amp;#x26; accomodation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took an overnight bus from Bogotá to Salento so we wouldn’t lose any precious daytime. We did plenty of research about the trip, nothing said it was dangerous and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bolivariano.com.co/&quot;&gt;Bolivariano&lt;/a&gt; came up top out of all of the different services. It cost us £12 each for the journey which was supposed to take around ten hours. Nothing on the internet and nobody warned us about how winding the roads were, or how crazy the driver would be. We snaked around the mountains for so long that people on the bus were throwing up in sick bags and no one could sleep as everyone was bracing themselves in their seat by their feet. It was easily the most horrific journey we’d done in three months in South America. Eventually the driver dropped us on the side of the road 8km out of Salento and told us to wait for a bus that comes every 15 minutes to finish our journey. The bus turned out to be a tiny collectivo that came every 30 minutes, we couldn’t fit on the first and ended up waiting a good 45 minutes before we could finally finish our journey to Salento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1580963-d11253739-Reviews-Hostal_Familiar_Jerico-Salento_Quindio_Department.html&quot;&gt;Hostel Familiar Jerico&lt;/a&gt; in a family room as we were now four and not two. The hostel was run by a Colombian family who didn’t really speak English but were really welcoming and made us possibly the best coffee we’ve ever had. It contained aguapanela (sugar cane water) and it was so good that after one sip Greeno was instantly converted into a coffee lover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Town&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salento is a small town in the Andes. Most of the houses are painted different colours, making it very photogenic. We walked to the edge of town and up some beautiful colourful steps for good views of the small Colombian town. Apart from eating, drinking or shopping there wasn’t much to do in Salento itself; it seemed very touristy and set up for the activities around it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made the most of a place called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/brunchdesalento/&quot;&gt;Brunch&lt;/a&gt; which we’d discovered after our horrendous journey to Salento. It was a backpacker cafe which did amazing massive breakfasts all day for just £4-5. We loved the food and portions so much, we ended up going to eat there every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tejo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d read about this game before we even got to Colombia and thought it would be fun to try. It turned out to be like an old school bowling alley. First we were told we had to have beer to play, four Club Colombia’s all round. We then had to choose a rock and the guy told us the aim was to hit the bits of gunpowder wrapped in paper around a metal ring. He showed us the best technique and told us how to keep score. Mainly we just wanted to hit the gunpowder to get it to explode. We all managed to hit the ring or gunpowder but Greeno was the only one who actually managed to make it go bang. After a while it got a little tedious and we gave up; but was a fun game to play for $3000COP (80p).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coffee Farm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deliberated over all the different coffee farms in the area and which one to visit; some offered in depth three hour tours, some were offered in English and others in Spanish. In the end we went with a 1.5 hour tour at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fincaelocasosalento.com/web2/en/&quot;&gt;Finca del Osaco&lt;/a&gt;. We walked the hour there downhill on the dirt track enjoying the lush green scenery and got a Willy Jeep back to town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two tours offered, a basic one for $15000COP (£4) and a premium tour for $65000COP (£17) the main difference being that we would get to try more types of coffee. We went with the cheaper option and our guide Andres showed us around the farm. It wasn’t a small or a family run coffee farm but it was interesting all the same. We got to pick and plant some beans and were shown how the beans are dried out and how coffee is made. At the end we got to try some medium roasted Colombian coffee which was very mild and weak compared to European coffee, but pretty good all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Valle del Cócora&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valle del Cocora is a valley full of Quindío wax palm trees which were left there from the Pacific Ocean. There were two ways to see the trees, to hike for 5-6 hours or to just walk the 1km path there and back. Luckily, Greeno and Iz were up for the hike. We’d read and been told that the best way was to go anti-clockwise, so that there was just one short steep climb upwards and the rest was downhill, it also meant we saw the trees in the valley at the end and not at the beginning. We’d been warned it was muddy and we could hire wellies at the beginning of the hike, however we’d also been told its not all muddy and 6 hours is a long time to spend in wellies. In the end we all decided to risk trainers and walking boots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we’d been warned, we weren’t really prepared for how muddy at least the first part of the hike was, think Glastonbury mud! Poor Iz put her foot in the first muddy puddle, up to her ankles, trainers ruined. The first part of the hike took a while as we were trying to navigate walking on the least muddy parts whilst not cutting ourselves on the barbed wire. The second part of the hike was through tropical forest. We’d hoped to see some wildlife but other than a lone kingfisher and some people riding horses we didn’t manage to see anything else. Although in the forest we had to cross the river over a number of rickety suspension bridges - great fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part was the climb uphill, we skipped the Hummingbird Sanctuary as it was 1.5 hours out of our way and we wanted to spend more time at the trees, especially as the sun was shining! The climb uphill was steep and a little slippy on the hard mud, it was a great feeling getting to the top, so much so that Greeno shouted “f**k me!” and everyone up there laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top we sat eating our lunch from Brunch with hummingbirds fluttering around us. We also made friends with the dog at the top, who liked to eat scraps of bread and Pringles but wasn’t a fan of tomato or cucumber. A lot of people had walked clockwise, seeing the trees first with a downhill walk through the forest and a lot of mud to end their hikes. We found it quite amusing when they saw the state of our trainers and boots and then looked down to their own immaculately clean vans and converse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a break we got to walk the dirt track downhill towards the trees. We took loads of photos of the absolutely gigantic palm trees in the middle of the Andes and then sat in the sun trying to dry out our socks and feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to get a Willy Jeep back at 14:00 and we’d started our hike at 08:00, not bad going as we’d made the most of our $5000COP entrance fees to see the infamous Colombian Quindío was palm trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hot chocolate with cheese&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d heard about hot chocolate with cheese and decided we needed to try it as a ‘Colombian delicacy’. It’s a bowl of hot chocolate (with cinnamon) and a big chunk of cheese. The idea is to cut up the cheese put it in the chocolate, let it melt a little and then eat it. Sounds gross but the cheese was very creamy and mild, think mozzarella not cheddar. It actually wasn’t half bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Salento&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all loved Salento, a sleepy colourful little town in the countryside. Greeno discovered his love for coffee (and hiking), we had amazing food, drank Mojitos, discovered Tejo and got to ride in Willy Jeeps. For anyone visiting Colombia in the future, Salento is a must!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bogotá, Colombia]]></title><description><![CDATA[“When grey streets are flooded with colour, the hearts of passers by are lifted by the brushstrokes, tones and creativity and they let their…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//bogota/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//bogota/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When grey streets are flooded with colour, the hearts of passers by are lifted by the brushstrokes, tones and creativity and they let their imaginations fly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivianne Pantojoa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graffiti Walking Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we decided to do in Bogotá was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bogotagraffiti.com/&quot;&gt;graffiti walking tour&lt;/a&gt;. We thought it would help us to get our bearings around the city, it had come recommended by many and because there was street art everywhere! Our first day in Colombia was a Sunday and there were soldiers all over the city, lots of things were closed so it was hard to work out if the areas we were walking around were dodgy or just closed because it was Sunday. It turned out to be election day which meant two things - soldiers all over the city at the polling stations and dry law. No alcohol is sold or to be consumed by law on Election Day in Colombia. We were not happy tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling safer with our graffiti guide to tour the city we wandered around La Candeleria and Downtown looking at the street art. The guide told us that street art is illegal in Bogotá but it is now recognised as a cultural expression and has been decriminalised. The guide explained this was because of two things that happened. The first was that two police shot a 17 year old boy, Diego Felipe Becerra, dead when he ran from them scared after he has been caught graffitiing. The second was that shortly after this event Justin Beiber visited Bogotá and graffitied in the city, except he was accompanied by the police as escorts for protection. Shortly after his graffiti was covered up by artists in protest and the government changed the law to decriminalise graffiti in Bogotá.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dry Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bogotá we became four as Iz and Greeno had joined us on our travels. After the walking tour we were looking forward to a nice cold beer to celebrate only to find out that there wasn’t going to be any. There is a law in Colombia that alcohol cannot be sold or consumed on Election Day meaning they many bars and restaurants were closed. We managed to find a Mexican restaurant for some food and went back to the Airbnb early with little else to do. We walked back to find that the road had been blocked off with TV crews and there was some kind of protest on the next block. We watched from the 11th floor that our apartment was on, a massive crowd had gathered outside the registry office in Bogotá and we think that they were watching the election results. We later found out this was the most peaceful Election Day in Colombian history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monseratte&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogotá is a very cloud and rainy city, we saw blue sky on a handful of occasions during our visit. We decided to risk the cloud and headed up to Cerro Monseratte hoping to catch some good views of Bogotá city. We got the cable car up which was $20,000 Colombian pesos return (£5.20). Monseratte went up to 3100 meters above sea level and air was definitely thinner up there. It was cloudy and at first we couldn’t see anything but eventually the clouds broke and we were able to appreciate how big Bogotá actually is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;La Chicha &amp;#x26; Chicken Wings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing about chica for around six weeks we finally got round to trying it! It’s fermented corn beer and people used to ferment it by chewing the corn and spitting it in a big tub. It isn’t made like this anymore but regardless it wasn’t good. It was very thick and tasted a little like fizzy apple cider.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walking tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the graffiti tour had very much focused on the art around the city we decided to do a generic walking tour on our last afternoon, mainly to knacker ourselves out for our overnight bus to Armenia. We learnt a little about Colombian politics, why ELN and FARC guerilla groups formed in the country and about the peace agreements with the FARC group that have led to them handing in their weapons. The guide also explained a little about the cartels and the paramilitary and how they also fit within the politics in the country. She talked about an open investigation where the Supreme Court of Justice in Bogotá had burned and hostages had been killed inside. She talked about how it’s believed this was initiated by a guerrilla group M19 but still remains unsolved.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide also told us a little about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Botero&quot;&gt;Fernando Botero&lt;/a&gt;, a famous Colombian artist and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez&quot;&gt;Gabriel García Márquez&lt;/a&gt;, a Colombian Nobel prize winner for literature. We wandered around the La Candelaria area during and after the tour, very annoyed that we were not staying another evening to explore the hipster bars in the neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Bogotá&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people had told us that Bogotá isn’t a nice city and not to bother but actually the two days we had in the city wasn’t nearly long enough! La Candeleria was definitely our kind of neighbourhood with shops and bars and somewhere we wished we could have spent more time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lima, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“For more than half the year Lima has a peculiar climate.

&lt;p&gt;“For more than half the year Lima has a peculiar climate. It is never cold enough to have a fire, but usually cold enough to make you wish for one. It never rains, but is never dry; that is to say, it is not wet enough to make one hold up an umbrella,yet wet enough to soak one’s clothes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Bryce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Miraflores&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Miraflores on the three occasions we passed through Lima, in an airbnb, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://lionbackpackers.com/&quot;&gt;Lion Backpackers Hostel&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/pe/190-la-casa-de-alvaro.en-gb.html?aid=357026;label=gog235jc-hotel-XX-pe-190NlaNcasaNdeNalvaro-unspec-co-com-L%3Aen-O%3Aabn-B%3Achrome-N%3AXX-S%3Abo-U%3AXX-H%3As;sid=7c3395775e805949feadf9a42f609d7e;dist=0&amp;#x26;group_adults=4&amp;#x26;group_children=0&amp;#x26;no_rooms=1&amp;#x26;sb_price_type=total&amp;#x26;type=total&amp;#x26;&quot;&gt;Guesthouse La Casa de Alvaro&lt;/a&gt;. We’d been told Miraflores was the place to stay but it was a strange area. There wasn’t much to do except grab some fast food, visit the artesanal markets or sit in a cheap cafe. It was also very noisy and the traffic was insane, drivers insessently honk their horns at one another all day long for no reason. The area mainly came to life at night and it turned out to be an alright place to grab a 2 for 1 pisco sour!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our favourite bits of Miraflores was our two day stay in an Airbnb; we had a fully equipped clean kitchen, which we didn’t have to share, a big comfy bed, a washing machine and we hibernated for two full days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lima has lots of parks spread all over the city. We walked to Parque del Amor which is on the coast; it hosts a big statue of a couple kissing and mosaic benches covered in couples names. We returned to the park with Iz when she arrived in Lima and walked the El Malecon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a wander through Kennedy Park, a central point in Miraflores. It was full of cats and there were signs everywhere advertising adoption of the cats to help the city to care for them. There was also a World Cup Sticker swap, so people were there with stacks of stickers swapping to fill their books, Dan was definitely a little jealous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the walk along the Miraflores coastline, we also hit a shopping centre called Lacomar. It was full of high street stores and set in the face of the cliff. Just outside was a sculpture of Paddington Bear in deepest darkest Peru, we couldn’t resist stopping for a photo.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Historical Centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walking tour in Lima took us to the historical centre. The guide was called Elvis and he’d actually been our guide for our walking tour in Cusco. He tried his best to tell us about Lima but it wasn’t easy when Lima is a very random and grey city. He showed us a few churches, one was called the Basilica of the Vera Cruz, it is believed there is a piece of the cross that Jesus was crucified on in the church. We saw the presidential palace and a marching band come out at one point playing music to the crowd. Initially we were hopeful that the historical centre would charm us into liking Lima after spending a lot of our time in Miraflores, sadly it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the walking tour we wandered into China Town to have some late lunch in a Chifa. The guide told us that there is a huge Chinese influence and culture within Peru as Chinese people had been brought over for cheap labour a long time ago, after slavery had been abolished and African people had been liberated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Barranco&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d heard Barranco was the hipster neighbourhood of Lima so went there to drink craft beers and cocktails in the hipster bars. Unlike other hipster areas in cities we had been to in Latin America, Barranco was a poor attempt! There wasn’t much street art in the area and although there were lots of bars, we felt like we could have been anywhere. We had a few Pisco Sours in the area and ate more Lomo Saltado in a nice restaurant called &lt;a href=&quot;http://isolina.pe/&quot;&gt;Isolina&lt;/a&gt;. Although the area wasn’t great our meal did not disppoint!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdict on Lima&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word to describe Lima would be grey. For a capital city, even in Latin America, it seemed behind the times. It wasn’t very pretty and seemed to be more of a hub for people going to more exciting destinations in Peru. This is exactly what we used Lima for and it served its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Huanchaco, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Yoga is not about touching your toes, it is what you learn on the way down.” Jigar Gor Yoga & Surfing Huanchaco is a little town in Peru…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//huanchaco/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//huanchaco/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yoga is not about touching your toes, it is what you learn on the way down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jigar Gor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yoga &amp;#x26; Surfing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huanchaco is a little town in Peru along the coast, not too far from the city of Trujillo. Our hostel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atmahuanchaco.com&quot;&gt;ATMA Hostel &amp;#x26; Yoga&lt;/a&gt; offered both daily yoga lessons and surfing equipment for free. The waves were absolutely huge and neither of us fancied being thrown off the boards in the milder weather, so we opted out of surfing and used our time to chill out by the coast. ATMA was possibly the best hostel we’d stayed in in Peru and it was also home to a cat called Fiddle, a turtle called Donoco and three very fluffy bunnies who had free reign of the courtyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t a lot to do in Huanchaco and we had been warned that the beaches weren’t great and were full of litter. The sand was very dark and it definitely wasn’t the kind of beach we’d sunbathe and relax on. It was such a quiet town, restuarants would shut by 18:00 if they had no customers and there wasn’t even a supermarket. We brought our food from the local ‘Mercardo’ which was incredibly cheap and ate out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/thelighthouserestaurante/&quot;&gt;The Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; two nights in a row. They did incredible wings and kebabs cooked on a barbeque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather was really cold and foggy in the evenings, but we were lucky enough to catch one sunset in Huanchaco! We never actually saw any of the fisherman in their Caballito de Totora boats made from local reeds, but we did get the iconic Huanchaco picture of the boats at sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chan Chan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason we’d ventured so far north, further north than most tourists bother to go, was to see the ancient ruins of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Chan&quot;&gt;Chan Chan&lt;/a&gt; and Kuelap. Sadly Kuelap is in Chachapoyas and we ran out of time to go so far north. However, we did manage to get as far as Chan Chan. In the south of Peru we’d learnt a lot about the Incas but there were other pre-colombian civilisations before the Inca’s, such as the Chimu and the Moche people. Chan Chan was located in between Trujillo and Huanchaco so we caught a public bus for 30p and paid the entrance fee of £1.10, instead of £2.20 because we had ISIC student cards. This was pittance compared to what we paid for Machu Picchu.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan Chan definitely wasn’t as grand as Machu Picchu, however it was much bigger, spanning 20kms in pre-colombian times, 900 - 1470AD! We were offered a guide but they only spoke in Spanish so we decided to wonder around for ourselves. Sadly, there was no information in the site, in either Spanish or English and overall we were a little disappointed with Chan Chan. There is now an ugly roof over the top of the section of the ruins that have been restored in Chan Chan meaning it was impossible to get the iconic photo of the ruins. It also meant we couldn’t walk through all of it and the bamboo posts made it difficult to imagine the areas as rooms, houses, graves and plazas.  However we were able to wander through some parts that hadn’t been restored fully and we managed to get a feel for how big Chan Chan was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Huaca de la Luna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temple of the moon was on the other side of Trujillo and we’d heard his was worth a visit, despite being further away than Chan Chan. Feeling adventurous, we got a bus into Trujillo and then a collectivo to the ruins. We had to wait 45 minutes for a guide in English, as visitors can only see the ruins with a guide, so we wondered around the museum which was full of artifacts excavated from the site. This turned out to be really interesting with all the information about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moche_culture&quot;&gt;Moche&lt;/a&gt; culture and the purpose of Huaca de la Luna in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the temples are referred to as Huaca de la Luna and Huaca del Sol (Temple of the Moon and Temple of the Sun). However, we were only able to visit the Temple of the Moon. The ruins were discovered in the 1990’s and sadly five years ago funding and sponsorship stopped, subsequently archaeologists stopped excavating the site and Huaca del Sol is not open to the public. We were shown around the ruins with our guide who explained that the temples were created between 100-700AD and that the Moche culture used Temple of the Moon for religious purposes. She explained priests ruled their civilizations and that they made annual human sacrifices to the Gods, but also when a natural disaster occurred such as an earthquake or heavy rain as they believed the Gods were angry with them. They did this by having male warriors fight, the loser was stripped naked and brought back to the temple where they were sacrificed. She said their blood was drained first and either poured on the ground or drank by the high priests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temple itself was really well preserved and we were able to see the original colours from the Moche peoples depictions of the decapitated God, who they made sacrifices to. This is because every 100 years the Moche people built over the already existing pyramid to make it bigger, therefore inner pyramids had been covered in sand and kept safe from sunlight and weather. In our opinion this was way more interesting than Chan Chan and definitely worth the £2.20 to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trujillo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d heard mixed reviews about Trujillo, some saying it wasn’t worth visiting and other saying the Plaza de Armas was stunning and worth a quick stop. On our way back from Huaca de la Luna we decided to grab a late lunch from the historical centre of Trujillo. The coloured colonial buildings around the Plaza de Armas reminded us of some parts of Arequipa and we thought the Plaza de Armas was worth the quick visit before jumping on a collectivo back to Huanchaco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Huanchaco&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who surfed seemed to be staying in Huanchaco for at least a couple of weeks, for us it was a nice lazy town where we could rest for a few days before heading back to the bustling city of Lima. We had intended to go further north than Huanchaco to Chachapoyas to visit some more ruins. However, due to cramming in the Amazon Rainforest (no regrets there) Huanchaco was as far north in Peru as we’d get. The Temple of the Moon was definitely worth a visit and for the price so was Chan Chan!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Huaraz, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“A lake is the landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature.

&lt;p&gt;“A lake is the landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature. It is earth’s eye; looking into which he beholder measures the depth of his own nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry David Thoreau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Huaraz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took an overnight bus from Lima to Huaraz which left at 21:30 and dumped us in Huaraz at 06:30. Very disorientated and tired, as there was more than one snorer on the bus, we tried to find our hostel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/pe/vacahouse-huaraz-b-b.en-gb.html?aid=357026;label=gog235jc-hotel-XX-pe-vacahouseNhuarazNbNb-unspec-pe-com-L%3Aen-O%3AwindowsS10-B%3Achrome-N%3AXX-S%3Abo-U%3AXX-H%3As;sid=afa45bdb0846f6aa56e77743f5f154c6;dist=0&amp;#x26;sb_price_type=total&amp;#x26;type=total&amp;#x26;&quot;&gt;Vacahouse B&amp;#x26;B&lt;/a&gt;. However, we didn’t realise there was more than one so around an hour and a cheap motortaxi ride later we managed to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huaraz itself is a small city and it isn’t very touristy, it’s more of a hub for people who are trekking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huascar%C3%A1n_National_Park&quot;&gt;Huascaran National Park&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also 3052 meters above sea level, up in the Andes, so we were also conscious to take it easy at first to avoid altitude sickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mercado Central de Huaraz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the Plaza de Armas, which was home to a crumbling derelict church, there really wasn’t a lot to see in the city. However, we’d read a few blogs that said the market was worth a visit. We’d been to a few of these in South America and you’d think we’d have learnt our lesson; mostly they contain fruit, strange herbal medicines and smelly unrefridgerated meat. Mercardo Central de Huaraz was no different, we pretty much ran through it holding our noses, stopping for a quick picture of the skinned and gutted guinea pigs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Laguna 69&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d been warned by a friend who had previously done this hike that it was difficult because of the altitude. His exact words were “Laguna 69 trek, it may kill you but worth it”. We booked a tour, mainly because it was easier and the same price as getting there by public transport. We were picked up at 05:00 and taken for breakfast in the middle of nowhere on the way before making our way to the starting point for the hike. Laguna 69 is located in Huascaran National Park and reaches 4604 meters above sea level. We started the hike at around 3800 meters and the first hour was pretty flat, the only challenge was getting around the cows blocking the paths.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came our first climb, it was reassuring that people on our tour muttered “it’s hard” as we kept crossing each other on the path. Due to the altitude, we had less oxygen and less energy so every step up was effort. Dan reached the top before me and I thought we’d made it. But it turned out we were about halfway and we’d reached a green coloured lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were graced with a break in climbing, as we crossed along another flat part of the hike before the even steeper climb up to Laguna 69. We managed to spot a Viscacha, which are rodents native to South America, they look like a cross between a rabbit and a squirrel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last climb up was even more effort, we and everyone who’d kept our pace, had to keep stopping every 4-5 meters to catch their breath. The altitude made the hike so much harder, but we got a final burst of energy when a guide told us we were about five minutes from the top.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were so pleased when we saw the blue water and we knew we’d made it. We were told it would take us around three hours to get to the top but we did it in two hours and forty five minutes, it took some of the others three and a half hours to get to the top. We took lots of photo’s and ate our picnic lunch just as it started to hail, ready for the two hour walk back down. Because it had been raining whilst we were at the top, the paths on the way down had turned into streams but we didn’t care as the 7km walk down was so much easier than the climb up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Huaraz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mainly visited Huaraz to hike to Laguna 69 and we were glad we did. It was the hardest hike we’d done (ever) but it was worth it for the views of the sapphire blue lake and the stunning scenery in Huascaran National Park.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ica, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“All journeys have secret destinations of which the traveller is unaware.” Martin Buber.

&lt;p&gt;“All journeys have secret destinations of which the traveller is unaware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Buber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Huacachina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t actually stay in Ica, opting to stay instead by a little oasis in the desert called Huacachina, just outside of Ica.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainly people come here to ride the sand dunes in a sand buggy and to sandboard. There wasn’t a lot to do here other than this, so we stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/pe/il-vecchio-bungalows.en-gb.html?aid=357026;label=gog235jc-hotel-XX-pe-ilNvecchioNbungalows-unspec-pe-com-L%3Aen-O%3AwindowsS10-B%3Achrome-N%3AXX-S%3Abo-U%3AXX-H%3As;sid=9474d9d1bdb38f3e4d3c5b8158430d7d;dist=0&amp;#x26;sb_price_type=total&amp;#x26;type=total&amp;#x26;&quot;&gt;Rochabus Hostel&lt;/a&gt; which had a pool and some hammocks to fill our free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sandboarding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked our sandboarding trip through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.findlocaltrips.com/&quot;&gt;Find Local Trips&lt;/a&gt; which came recommended by the Bolivia/Peru Hop buses, it also appeared to be good value for money. At around 16:00 we strapped into our 14 seater buggy and headed for the dunes. However, initally our buggy got turned away and went back into town, the driver picked up his wife and kid. It seemed that we hadn’t been allowed up there as the buggy wasn’t full. Eventually we got up the first dune, ready for our rollercoaster ride over the dunes and the buggy was super slow. After messing around with it for 10-15 minutes, the driver gave up and called for another buggy; not a great start! The second one was tiny, there was only really room for four people in the back but it had five straps so we had to squeeze in, we didn’t see any other buggy’s with five in the back. The driver didn’t seem to care and he drove up and down the dunes whilst we bumped around squished in the back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we reached the first dune to sandboard down, it was steep but wasn’t so high. We had great fun and then went down two smaller ones but pumped full of adrenaline we hoped that they’d get higher! We got back in the buggy, the driver raced up and down the dunes but a few minutes later the axel for the back wheels bent. The driver looked really annoyed but we figured it was because they’d shoved too many of us in the buggy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to wait there for around 15 minutes for yet another buggy, we couldn’t sandboard as we couldn’t get back up the dune and the sun was setting fast. An even smaller buggy came and we squashed in to race up the dunes to catch the sunset. As the driver pulled up the sun sank behind the dunes, we’d missed it! We couldn’t believe our bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nazca Lines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazca is two and a half hours away from Huacachina so we caught a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cruzdelsur.com.pe/&quot;&gt;Cruz del Sur&lt;/a&gt; bus there and back. These were double the price of the public bus (£6 one way) but they were quicker, more reliable and we were able to watch a film. Historically there have been lots of accidents with flights going over the Nazca Lines, so we did a lot of research and went with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movilair.com.pe/en/&quot;&gt;Movil Air&lt;/a&gt; who we’d read had newer planes, more experienced pilots and their planes were bigger, holding twelve passengers not six. We checked in at the ‘airport’ but were sent off in a group of six; we were given a map of the lines and realised we’d been shoved with a different plane company, Air Brag.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plane was really small and we had to wear headphones. We’d already been told that the planes tip left and right which can make people sick, so we’d taken anti-sickness tablets before and hadn’t eaten all day, just in case. Before take off, Dan saw an error message come up ‘transponder failed’, the pilot cleared it and continued to the runway. This did not fill us with confidence! We took off and saw each of the ancient geoglyphs from the sky. The plane tipped from side to side so everyone got a good view and it wasn’t long until the woman sat behind me chundered into her sick bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geoglyphs are thought to be from the Nazca culture, between 500 BC and 500 AD. Archaeologists, historians, and mathematicians have all tried to determine the purpose of the Nazca lines; they hypothise that they were either made for the Gods, they are related to astronomy or were created to summon water. Either way they were pretty cool to see from the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a bit of turbulence in the little plane which felt so much worse than in a big aircraft. We loved seeing the amazing geoglyphs from the air and for £65 the flight was well worth it, but were very pleased to have our feet on the ground again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Ica&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mainly went to Ica to stay in Huacachina for some adrenaline filled sandboarding and sand buggying; sadly this didn’t really happen due to two of the buggy’s breaking on us! The Nazca Lines however did not disappoint and to fly in such a small plane over the geoglyphs was another thing ticked off the bucket list.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Amazon Rainforest, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“It seems to me that the natural world is the greatest source of excitement the greatest source of visual beauty the greatest source of…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//the-amazon-rainforest/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//the-amazon-rainforest/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems to me that the natural world is the greatest source of excitement the greatest source of visual beauty the greatest source of intellectual interest. It is the greatest source of so much in life that makes life worth living.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Attenborough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iquitos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing in Iquitos was a bit of a shock to the system, as soon as we walked outside we were swarmed by local taxi and motortaxi drivers offering to take us into Iquitos for various amounts of money. It was the most we had been harassed since arriving in South America, including on Copcabana Beach! We managed to find an offical taxi driver who weaved in and out of the traffic to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hospedajeneydita.com/&quot;&gt;Hostel Neydita&lt;/a&gt; where we were staying. The traffic was crazy; there were families of four balanced on one motorcycle, women breastfeeding their children on motorcycles and people sat in plastic chairs in the trailers attached to the motorcycles. We later learned that as Iquitos is only accessible by air or by a very long boat journey, there is a Honda motorcycle factory in the city where people can buy one for less than S./3000 (£672).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Belen Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were picked up in the morning by our guide, Osmar from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iquitos-tour.com/en/jungle-tours-Libertad&quot;&gt;Libertad Lodge&lt;/a&gt; where we would be staying in the Amazon for four days. We picked the lodge as it seemed to be good value for money; we could make our own itinerary, the money went towards helping the local community and there wasn’t a single bad review on Tripadvisor out of hundreds. It cost us $350 each (around £280) for three nights and four days all inclusive. We broke up the three hour journey there by firstly visiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lonelyplanet.com/peru/iquitos/attractions/belen/a/poi-sig/1277432/363385&quot;&gt;Belen Market&lt;/a&gt;. We had read that it was one of South America’s most bizarre markets, with all sorts of strange things for sale in ‘Shaman’s Alley’, such as monkeys hands, bird beaks, snake skins and ayahuasca by the bottle. Ayahuasca is a plant that has hallucagenic properties said to heal all sorts of problems when used by a Shaman; lots of tourists come to Peru to experience ayahuasca ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Osmar showed us around and pointed out all the tropical fruits and vegetables. He then took us around the part where people were selling meat; the weirdest thing we saw was a turtle without its shell, which people apparently eat. After getting to know Osmar a little better and how much he loves animals, we knew this was the reason why he didn’t take us to see anything really strange and in the end we were grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Dallas World Aquarium; Amazon Rescue Centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dwazoo.com/conservations/peru/centro-de-rescate-amazonico-amazon-rescue-center/&quot;&gt;The Amazon Rescue Centre&lt;/a&gt; started up ten years ago for rescued manatee’s and is now funded by Dallas University. For S/.20 (£5) each a guide showed us around and introduced us to all of the rescued animals they have there. He explained that the animals they have in CREA are rescued from local people who had them as pets. He explained that they are rehabilitated and then put back into the wild when they are deemed ready by biologists. We saw a two month old ocelot, a type of big cat, she was very cute and playful. Its owners had given her up when she started to bite. There were also two scartlett macaws there who had been mistreated, they guarded all of the rescued turtles. The guide demonstrated this by entering the pen and trying to pick up the turtles, the macaws chased him threatening to bite until he left the turtles alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also rescued otters, my favourite animal! One was only a baby and the guide said that his owners had caught him when he was young and never taught him to swim. He explained that they are currently giving him swimming lessons but he cries when he is ready to come out of the water!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also sloths and lots of monkeys. Sadly, the guide told us that once monkeys had become domesticated and dependent on humans, because of how smart they are, they are not able to rehabilitate them back to the wild completely. The guide explained that they go to places such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://laisladelosmonos.org/&quot;&gt;Monkey Island&lt;/a&gt; where they are able to live in the rainforest, but tourists visit and give them food. Lastly we saw the manatee’s; there were three. The guide told us there are more but they are closer to being released so are in the rehabilitation centre. He explained that rehabilitation takes three years in total for each manatee and in ten years they have successfully rehabilitated around twenty. There was one manatee isolated in his own pool, the guide said that he had been found with a plastic bag in his stomach which he had swallowed due to it being in all the vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide told us that although they are a rescue centre, their main purpose is to educate the local children. He said when children come to visit they talk about the exotic pets they have at home at the beginning of their visit, but by the end they know that it is wrong and that the animals should be free. He said many of the children actually come back with their parents to donate their pets to the centre. The guide explained that the older generation are stuck in their ways and will continue to hunt manatee and kill turtles for meat, but that they hope educating the younger generation will help make a difference to the animals of the rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Libertad Lodge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a two hour drive and an hour and a half on a motorboat, we finally reached Libertad Village. The lodge was on stilts due to the flooding during rainy season, however we were visiting just at the end, so although it was muddy we could walk on the land around the lodge. We had a cute bungalow with a bathroom and most importantly a mosquito net! The village is located in the Pacaya Samira National Reserve and there are around 350 people living in the village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Searching for sloths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we headed out on our boat to look for three-toed sloths. We found one pretty quickly hanging down from the tree. The guide told us all about them, how they move around four different trees a day and will come down once a week to defecate under the tree it lives in to help to fertilise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dolphins at sunset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up doing this twice, but we were lucky enough to spot Amazon river dolphins every time we went into the Rio Ucayali near the lodge. There were two types, pink  which were shyer, had a longer snout and a rounder dorsel fin, and grey tucuxi dolphins which were more playful and easier to spot. We sat with the motor off for a long time watching the pink sunset turn the murky water lilac, with the dolphins popping up out of the water all around us. At one point, Manuel one of our drivers, did donuts in the water in the boat to disturb the fish and get the dolphins closer to us. There were parts of the water we could swim in but the water was so murky and knowing that there were piranha, water snakes and stingrays in there, neither of us were brave enough to take a dunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tarantulas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had expected to go hunting for tarantula and got ready in our wellies, long sleeves and headtorches for a night hike, but it turned out there were lots of tarantula on the other side of the village. Peruvian pinktoe tarantulas; they live in the trees so we didn’t have to get too close. We got a few pictures and our guide asked if we wanted to hold one, he told us that they bite and can be venomous but mostly to paralyse their prey such as insects and that their hairs are just irritating to human skin. We weren’t sure if he was joking but said no as we didn’t fancy getting bitten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hiking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a lot of time in the rainforest on our boat. As it was the end of rainy season, the local rainforest was ‘flooded forest’. We did however do a couple of hours hiking when we managed to find some land. Firstly, Manuel our driver had to navigate through a creek, because the creeks were drying out, there were lots of logs and tree roots to navigate through. At one point the boat got stuck on a tree stump and I thought it was going to tip over; both guides had to get out in their wellies to dislodge it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land was muddy and in parts flooded. On foot, we managed to spot some common squirrel monkey’s and red howler monkeys. Even Manuel got really excited when we spotted the red howler’s as these are really hard to find. Whilst we were walking, Osmar had a bullet ant on his boot and Manuel managed to get it off with his machete before he was bitten. The guide explained that bullet ant bites are supposed to be really painful for 24 hours. Osmar also showed us a fruit with a grub inside and said we could eat it. When we both said we were full he ate it and said it tasted like coconut. He also collected some mocambo fruits which he said we could try on the way back and he would roast the nuts on the inside for us with our dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monkeys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back, the guide opened some of the mocambo fruits for us to try. They were stringy and pretty tasteless. Manuel pulled in towards some trees, we weren’t sure why until a monkey jumped in the boat, sat on our laps and started helping herself to the mocambo fruit in Dan’s hand! Two more then joined in. The guide told us that they were common woolly monkey’s and they had been rescued from a market by the local people. He said that although they could collect their own fruits and nuts, whenever they heard an engine, they knew it was the sound of humans which meant food and they would come down to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They absolutely loved scooping the flesh out of the mocambo fruit and when they had finished they cuddled up together on the guides lap before coming over and doing the same on ours. They were really soft and their tails were like an extra arm, wrapping around things. It was such a great surprise and Osmar and Manuel had clearly had it planned all along!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw lots of different types of monkey’s during our time in the Amazon. We spotted a few monk saki monkey’s, titi monkeys and some capuchins high in the tree tops and the guide took us to a spot where some pygmy marmoset monkeys lived, the smallest type of monkey in South America. We watched one licking the tree sap. We also saw some owl monkeys, they’re nocturnal so the guide had to hit the tree with a vine to get them to come out and see what was going on. The monkey’s were  either small, so quick or so high up in the tree tops it made it almost impossible to get a good photo unless we had invested in an expensive lens as long as our arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Searching for caiman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were nervous about looking for caiman at night, especially in the lodges tiny boats and because Osmar had said we’d try and catch one. Manuel drove the boat through a small creek and after a while we hit a lot of vegetation, mostly lillipads and water lettuce. This also meant lots of insects, there were thousands of them. Because of the light from our headtorches there were mosquitos and flies in our faces and grasshoppers, spiders, crickets and frogs were all jumping in the boat. The thick vegetation was building up at the front of the boat preventing us from going anywhere and we knew there were caiman in the water. After the ordeal was over, we asked the guide about the big spider’s we’d seen, he said they were wandering spiders but the aquatic kind not the deadly ones to humans. He told us they often find water snakes in the vegetation too which get lifted up towards the boat, luckily this hadn’t happened to us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osmar told us we were looking for red eyes in the vegetation and it wasn’t long before he found a baby caiman. He told us we could hold it but with the crickets, frogs and mosquitos buzzing and hopping around us we decided not to. He told us a little about them and said its mother would be somewhere in the vegetation too. The black caiman can grow up to six meters long and Osmar told us about the time he had been bitten by a small caiman on his hand. We were pleased when we came out of caiman territory and able to relax on the boat ride back to the lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunrise in the Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We woke up at 05:00 to see the sunrise over Rio Ucayali. Although it was cloudy, there was a gap and when the sun came up it was really orange. Some of the dolphins were about swimming around the boat again. Osmar explained on a good day the sun is really big and lights up the whole of the river. We were happy with the sunrise we’d experienced and crawled back into bed for a siesta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fishing for piranha&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went on a day excursion with Osmar and Roland, one of the chef’s in the lodge and a local fisherman. We saw a few lakes and found some land to cook lunch. He made a fire and cooked us rice, chicken and fried plantane. It was delicious, it then absolutely poured it down so it looked like we were out of luck and couldn’t spend the afternoon fishing. There was thunder and lightening and after waiting a while we gave up and headed back to the Lodge. However, it stopped on the way back so Roland pulled into some fishing spots for us to try and catch some dinner. Between us we caught six catfish and a red-bellied piranha.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d been told that once there was a bite to lift the rod up sharply to get the fish into the boat, however when Dan caught the piranha, as he flicked the rod into the air it wriggled off of the hook and hit me in the back. They were really mean looking and Osmar told us to be careful as they would bite and take a chunk of flesh. Roland later cooked them up for dinner, although they were small the meat on them was really tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Snakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d been to a lake hunting for snakes basking in the trees but we hadn’t managed to find any. Osmar told us that snakes are very random, on some days he sees none and on others two or three. On the last day he told us he had a surprise for us, we’d gotten used to Osmar and his surprises and usually they didn’t disappoint. He took us around Libertad Village, the kids started to follow us and Osmar told us we were at Roland’s house. Underneath was a wooden box and Osmar said that Roland had caught a three metre long boa constrictor. He explained that it had been caught up in his fishing net, so they had freed it and Roland was waiting for it’s scars to heal before releasing it back into the wild. The kids gathered around underneath the house whilst Omar took the nails out of the top of the box to get it out. It immediately started hissing and going for Osmar and Roland, it sounded angry. When they did manage to get it out you could see how powerful it was and how hard they had to work to stop it from wrapping around their arms and squeezing tightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on the Amazon Rainforest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We absolutely loved the Amazon! It was really relaxing to spend four days without technology, eating local tropical fruits and going out everyday to see animals in the wild. Even though we ended up with more than 100 mosquito bites altogether (we now look like we have chicken pox) and at times were covered in bugs, feeding monkeys and being surrounded by dolphins at sunset was absolutely incredible. We can’t thank Libertad Lodge, our guide Osmar and the locals enough for having us, allowing us to stay in their village and taking us out on their boats to see some of the wildlife in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cusco, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“The word that most perfectly describes the city of Cusco is evocative.

&lt;p&gt;“The word that most perfectly describes the city of Cusco is evocative. Intangible dust of another era settles on its streets, rising like the disturbed sediment of a muddy lake when you touch its bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Che Guevara&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cusco City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cusco is a really charming city, it sits in a valley surrounded by hills with a huge Plaza de Armas and lots of cobbled narrow streets in the centre. We arrived on an overnight bus from Arequipa with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cruzdelsur.com.pe/&quot;&gt;Cruz del Sur&lt;/a&gt; for £29, pricey for Peru but it was the best overnight bus we’d been on so far! We had our own TV, choice of movie and a VIP lounge in the bus station which included sofas and a clean toilet. We stayed in the Santiago District in a hostel called &lt;a href=&quot;http://hostelincusco.com/&quot;&gt;Tayta Wasi&lt;/a&gt;, it was a big room with hot water, at £7 each a night it was great value for money too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our second day in Cusco we did a free walking tour. The guide talked a lot about the Spanish conquest; how the people that had been living in Cusco at the time had been a civilised nation but that the Spanish did not portray them in this way. He said the Spanish described them as naked savages but he pointed out in Cusco it’s too cold to be naked. Cusco was the centre of the Inca Empire which stretched from Colombia to Chile. The guide explained why llama were so important; they can carry 60kg and walk all day so without llama the Incas would not have been able to conquer their territory so quickly. The guide was passionate about Cusco’s history but even more so about football in Peru. He said that their best player was Guerrero but he had been suspended for taking a banned substance. His suspension was under appeal which would be decided before the World Cup squads could be announced but they were hopeful Guerrero would be available for selection, he acutally received a 14 month ban (FYI, Dan added this bit in).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were going to visit a white Jesus statue at the top of the hill but we were told it was S./130 to visit by the couple from New York we met on the Inca Jungle. We later found out that this wasn’t the case and it was free to visit, but it was too late to go up there by then. Instead we visited San Cristobal Church for a view of Cusco City. It took us a while to hobble up the stairs to the church as our legs ached from Machu Picchu and we continued to hobble about for four days after. There were a few llama and some ladies selling their crafts at San Cristobal, it was nice to sit somewhere peaceful and watch the city below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;San Pedro Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Pedro is a market in the middle of Cusco city, it was designed by the same man who designed the Eiffel Tower, Gustave Eiffel. However it’s definitely not as impressive! The market contained mostly food; fruit, vegetables, medicinal plants and unrefrigerated meat! We thought it was horrific until we later drove through a street full of dead pigs for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also visited San Pedro on our walking tour; the guide told us about a cactus plant, Hauchuma. People who live in the Andes believe Huachuma can help cure almost all mental health problems. He explained that people who live in the mountains use natural plants and rarely visit the doctor. People take Hauchuma just before they go to sleep and then have very vivid dreams due to the plants hallucegenic properties. When they wake they are cured of things like depression, anxiety, doubts and have answers to their questions about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Casa Concha Museum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casa Concha Museum is in an old colonial building in the centre of the city. It contains items from Machu Picchu that were collected by Hiram Bingham, not the first person to find it, but the first to make a scientific discovery of it in 1912. The Peruvians we met evidently disliked Hiram Bingham and referred to him as a ‘treasure hunter’ not as a scientist. They believe that he stole the Inca Gold that would have been buried with the mummies in Machu Picchu, as lots of Inca Gold later arrived on the black market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information in the museum put a lot of what we had seen at Machu Picchu in context. The Museum also had information about how the Incas shaped babies skulls as it was more desirable for their skulls to be long, and there were human bones among the pottery on display. There were lots of chicha cases, something we are yet to try! The Incas were apparently big fans of alcohol and made beer from corn. They fermented it by chewing the corn and spitting it into a big clay vase. Apparently it’s not made like this anymore but people still drink chicha.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum explained that scientists believe that Machu Picchu was a country retreat for the Inca King and his family. They believe that it wasn’t an important place as the Spanish did not destroy or build on top of it, as they did everywhere else, and it is not on a main route of the Inca Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Qorikancha&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the most important temple in Inca Empire, it’s a Quechua word meaning gold enclosure. It was originally a temple dedicated to Inti, the sun god but was destroyed and looted during the Spanish conquest. It’s foundations were used to build the Church of San Domingo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t much to see actually inside Qorikancha in regards to the Incas; it was full of religious art from the church. However the stone blocks forming the part of the building of the Inca Temple was similar to those we had seen of the temples of Machu Picchu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shopping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were so many colourful llama items in Cusco and it was so cheap; S./25 (£5.65) for a jumper, S./5 (£1.13) for socks and S./50 (£11.30) for giant blankets, we couldn’t resist and in the end brought so much we had to pay to post most of it back home in a box!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chinchero, Maras &amp;#x26; Moray&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinchero, Maras and Moray are all outside of Cusco and we visited them on a day trip. The first stop was Chinchero where we visited an indigenous family; they showed us how they cook and make textiles. Dan and I were really distracted by the guinea pig hutches which were full of the squeaky creatures, not kept as pets but for food! They are raised for at least six months before they are eaten and guinea pig is (an expensive) local delicacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moray was a site used by the Inca’s as a laboratory to test where vegetables, fruits and medicinal plants grow best. It consists of rings that get higher and higher which changes the temperature and the altitude. The guide explained that the Incas grew different things at different heights using different types of soil so they knew where best to grow their crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maras is a salt mine that is still working today and provides most of southern Peru with its salt. The salty water, which has a higher content of salt than sea water, it is believed comes from a volcano as it is also warm, but this isn’t known for definite. Families own pools in the mine and can get hundreds of kilos of salt out of a pool in a year. The different colours are down to the content of salt and this is dependent on the water evaporating by the sun. The mine was used in Inca times although it is believed that was not as big as it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Food &amp;#x26; drinks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered Peruvian food in Arequipa but it just seemed to get better and better. Our first stop was &lt;a href=&quot;http://jackscafecusco.com&quot;&gt;Jack’s Cafe&lt;/a&gt; which was in Cusco six years ago when I first visited, they do the most amazing breakfasts. We went there twice, once for a full English and once for American Pancakes. We ate at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cuzcoeats.com/pollo-la-brasa-urban-perus-favorite-food/&quot;&gt;Los Todos Pollo&lt;/a&gt; twice too, a place where you can get a massive 1/4 chicken and chips for S./16, just under £4, Dan’s favourite! We had a curry at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/KormaSutraCusco&quot;&gt;Korma Sutra&lt;/a&gt;; Alpaca chilli and mango which was delicious and we tried their tandoori fried cuy. The meat was a little chewy; like chicken thigh and luckily the guinea pig didn’t have a head! We had Peruvian Chinese at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cuscorestaurants.com/restaurant/kion/&quot;&gt;Kion&lt;/a&gt; which was probably the best meal we’d had so far in Peru, arroz chaufas and spicy noodles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again we had more than our fill of Pisco Sours as there seemed to be happy hour everywhere all day! We went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theonlyperuguide.com/peru-guide/cusco/nightlife/mama-africas/&quot;&gt;Mama Africa&lt;/a&gt;, a club that offered free salsa lessons, but again Dan couldn’t be convinced to dance salsa. However, we did go there after a bit later on; people were dancing on the bar to reggaeton music and had their faces painted. We definitely have a song of South America now too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Cusco&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We loved this city and we were gutted we couldn’t spent longer there. There were so many things we didn’t have time to do; a tour of the Sacred Valley, Sacsaywaman, Rainbow Mountain and there were lots of churches and museums we didn’t have time to explore. Cusco, we’ll be back!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Inca Jungle, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“I’m struggling here, if I’m honest with you.

&lt;p&gt;“I’m struggling here, if I’m honest with you. I don’t know how to sell it with… Do you like llamas?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Pilkington on Machu Picchu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inca Jungle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked the Inca Jungle before we left the UK, as we knew that some of the treks get booked up months in advance to Machu Picchu, mainly the four day classic Inca Trail. We booked Inca Jungle with &lt;a href=&quot;http://lokihostel.com/en/travel&quot;&gt;Loki Travel&lt;/a&gt;, we were sceptical as they have a reputation for being a party hostel, however the Inca Jungle was cheaper than elsewhere, £186 all inclusive. We didn’t fancy hiking on the four day classic Inca Trail and the Inca Jungle seemed a little more adventurous. We decided on the three day Inca Jungle, the classic one is four days, but this meant we missed out the day of hiking and instead we’d get a taxi to catch up with the four day group that left the day before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to be at Loki Hostel for 06:30AM, which was a killer as it was the other side of Cusco to where we were staying. We were driven to Ollytaytambo to get some final things we might need; Dan and I had been prepared and had everything we needed but couldn’t resist the overpriced Dairy Milk Caramel in the shop. We then drove for another hour and a half to the top of Alba Malaga Pass, a 4800 metre mountain which we were going to bike down.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was the safety gear; helmet, body armour, gloves, knee pads and a visibility jacket. The guide told us that the minivan would drive behind the group for safety reasons and he talked us through the nine gears on the bike and how to break safety. The ride was 50km with 90% of it being downhill and 10% of it flat, it had sheer drops and blind corners with lorries driving up and down. The guide mentioned biking through streams but we were on a main road so we thought he was joking. It was an easy bike ride in the sense that we didn’t have to pedal and just had to keep putting the breaks on for the corners. However, after the ‘halfway point’ we got lower and closer to the jungle so not only did it get so much hotter but we found out the guide wasn’t joking and we had to bike through streams over the road so we ended up soaked! It was surprisingly good fun and Dan and I managed to beat the rest of he group to the bottom!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short drive later we were in Santa María where the people who were doing the four day Inca jungle would be spending the night. As we’d opted for the three days, we had lunch there before getting our taxi to Santa Teresa to meet the other group. We had the option of rafting but I didn’t fancy it and Dan wanted to watch  the Champions League instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taxi turned out to be awful! The driver had so many cracks in his windscreen it was surprising he could see out of it at all. There were two locals in the taxi too, which made it a squeeze, and the driver blared his music the entire thirty minute drive. The gravelly road from Santa María to Santa Teresa was only wide enough for one car with a sheer drop at the one side and at one point he nearly crashed into the mountain. Eventually we arrived in Santa Teresa and no one really had a clue what was happening. The other half of the group and the guide were going to be arriving around four hours after us and we had been told to either wait at the lodge or head to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portalmachupicchu.com/en/things-to-do/hot-springs/hot-spring-of-santa-teresa/259/&quot;&gt;Banos Termales de Cocalmayo&lt;/a&gt; where we could try and find them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed straight to Cocalmayo hot springs and after a short walk in the wrong direction we managed to find it. The sun had gone down and after a long day it was amazing to relax in the hot water. The springs actually seemed clean and the water was clear too which made a change to the hot springs we’d been to in Bolivia. Once our fingers were like prunes we got out but showered in the hot spring showers first as we knew the hostel would only have cold water.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 20:30 the guide and the rest of the group arrived at the hostel. The guide told us we’d missed a great day hiking where the other group had tried lots of medicinal plants, coffee and Cuy (Guinea Pig). However, it seemed a little ironic that that evening the guy from New York was really sick and he seemed to think it was all the weird plants he’d felt obligated to try on the hike. The guide made us try his medicinal tea which apparently could cure most health problems, it was really bitter. He then somehow convinced us to sign up to the ziplining the following morning. After dinner he gave us a shot of Inca Tequila but Loki’s party reputation didn’t seem to be holding up and we were in bed by 21:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were up at 06:30 to do the ziplining with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294314-d3849665-Reviews-Zipline_Inka_Flyer_Santa_Teresa-Cusco_Cusco_Region.html&quot;&gt;Inca Flyer&lt;/a&gt;; 3km, 5 ziplines and a suspension bridge in the trees. We had to sign a waiver first to acknowledge that health and safety may not be the same as in our own country and that it was a risky activity and we may die. This totally filled us with confidence. We got to the first zipline which was over a huge valley and the Urubamba River. The only test was sending over one of the members of staff and we were then quickly shown how to break and told the guide would hold a yellow sign to slow down and red to break. In order to do this we had to hold onto the wire with our leather gloves on, compared to the zipline we had done in Wales the previous year this didn’t at all seem safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of people had gone it was our turn, luckily we survived unharmed and had great fun. By the fifth one Dan seemed to have forgotten his fear of heights and did the line like ‘Spiderman’, upside down!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full of adrenaline we decided to do the suspension bridge too which ended up being really scary! We had to walk along the rotting planks of wood up in the treetops and when we reached certain parts we had to balance unhook and hook our safety clips around the frame of he bridge. This was whilst other people were on the bridge making it wobble!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed straight towards Machu Picchu after this for our hike from the Hydroelectric station to Aguas Calientes, which was around three hours and along the train tracks. We didn’t realise until some time in, that the trains actually still drive on the line and constantly beeped to get people to move off and out of the way. We’d got talking to a couple from New York and a guy from Romania and as we were faster than the others our guide told us all to walk ahead but meet him and the rest of the group at the first carriages. We got there in under an hour and decided to go in the bar opposite for a drink and some shade whilst we waited for the rest. We waited for 45 minutes but there was no sign of the group so we decided to carry on walking and had to ring Loki when we got phone signal. Once we got to Agues Calientes we caught up with our guide and the rest of the group, who hadn’t bothered to check if we were in the bar when they got to the carriages and they’d carried on ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was then a massive dispute over the rooms. Three couples refused to share dorms but hadn’t paid for a private room; they were exceptionally rude to our guide. After a very awkward five minutes they agreed to pay more and went to another hostel. The rest of us weren’t fussed about where we slept and ended up each having rooms of our own now anyway. Dan and I started to put our bed bug guards on our beds and then we saw them. Bed bugs! One of the beds was infested they were in between the blankets and on the sheets and they looked like head lice. We gathered up our things and threw them into the hallway. We told the guide who was really apologetic, he seemed to be having a really terrible day! We were moved to the other hostel with no extra cost. We later met for our ‘final supper’ as we had a different guide at Machu Picchu, and on the way we had our first close encounter with the Peruvian hairless dog, a black dog with no hair except for a blonde tuft on top of its head. The guide gave us a free Pisco Sour, which helped us get to sleep by 21:30 ready for a 03:45 get up the next morning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the first bus didn’t leave until 05:30, we arrived at 04:20 and there were already a lot of people in front of us. We ate our breakfast in the queue and ignored the fact that it had started to rain. By 05:40 we were on a bus on the way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu&quot;&gt;Machu Picchu&lt;/a&gt;, unfortunately as we got higher there was more cloud and more rain. Not the kind of rain we get in the UK, it was like a rainforest downpour and within minutes our waterproof jackets were soaked through, our waterproof covers on our backpacks failed to work and our waterproof walking boots were soaked too. We managed to find our guide and as half the group hadn’t yet come up we were ushered off with another guide to start our two hour walking tour.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really hard to appreciate Machu Picchu’s magnificence to begin with as we were tired, cold, soaked, the rain wasn’t easing up and half of Machu Picchu was covered in cloud. Our guide walked us through the ruined city, pointing out the temples, sacrificial stones, the school and explaining how they cut the stone. Even in the pouring rain, our guide remained really upbeat. He also told us that the name Machu Picchu means ‘old mountain’ in Quechua, the universal language at the time of the Incas and that it is actually a reference to the mountain behind the city, not the city itself. He explained no one really knows what the city was actually called. We were also just about able to see Huayna Picchu, meaning ‘young mountain’, both can be climbed for an extra cost but have to be booked months in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one good thing about the rain was that it demonstrated how the Inca drainage systems still worked today, 500 years later. At the end of the tour were two huts with a roof, where we were finally able to get some shelter. By then everything was soaked through and we were dithering, praying the clouds would break and the sun would beam like it had done the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully after around an hour the clouds started to disappear and the rain stopped. We walked the rest of the city on our own before heading out to use the toilet and have some lunch. When we re-entered Machu Picchu we were finally able to have our ‘wow’ moment of the magnificence of Machu Picchu. We went up to the guard house first for the ‘postcard picture’. We had to wait in line at the good spots and at one of them a couple spent ages taking a photo of a cuddly llama in front of Machu Picchu before filming themselves chanting Machu Picchu in their Machu Picchu tshirts. We thought this was a bit much. Another girl did the classic jumping pose and was told off by the guards, not only did they tell her jumping was forbidden but they made her delete her photos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we walked up to Intipunku (the sun gate), the sun was blaring and it felt like tropical jungle; insect repellent and sun cream was needed! On the forty minute hike to Intipunku there were lots of llamas. The guide had told us that llamas are supposed to live in the highlands for the right diet so they are unhappy as they have the wrong type of grass at Machu Picchu as it is at lower altitude. One of them went a bit rogue as it came up the stairs in between tourists, it almost trod on a little girl and then stormed at two other llamas in the field. The other two ran off and as they were chased they ran into a group of about six people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got great views at Inkipuntu of Machu Picchu and the place was starting to get a quieter as people had taken their photos and were starting to get the buses down. Sadly, Machu Picchu had changed a lot since I last visited six years ago; we were only allowed re-entry once, but the toilet was outside which meant we could only go to the toilet once during our visit. It also had a one way system which meant that we had to follow the arrows and if we took a wrong turn it was bad luck. We’d contemplated going to the Inca Bridge but unfortunately took a wrong turn. Instead we walked around the city unguided taking photos of the bits we hadn’t been able to that morning because of the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus up or down from Machu Picchu to Agues Calientes was $12 (£9) one way. We’d paid to go up but decided to do the hour walk down. It was further than we anticipated and by the last step down our legs were like jelly and our feet felt like they were going to drop off. We also couldn’t work out if they were still wet from the morning or whether they were now just sweaty from the heat. We headed straight to the hostel to change out of our boots before going to get a very late lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ride back to Cusco was a long one. We had a train to Ollytaytambo at 18:20 which took around an hour and a half and then a two hour bus journey back to Cusco. We’d been told that when we reached Ollytaytambo someone would be there with a sign with our names on. They weren’t but using our atrocious Spanglish we were able to find the right minivan back. By the time we got back to our hostel it was around 23:00 and it had been maybe the longest, but one of the best days of our trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verdict of Inca Jungle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inca Jungle was a really fun and adventurous way to reach Machu Picchu, especially as four days of hiking up and downhill, camping and carrying all of our gear for hundreds of pounds to do the classic Inca Trail didn’t really sound like our thing. Machu Picchu itself was phenomenal, even the second time around, and we were lucky in the end as we saw the drainage systems working in the rain, we were able to take photos up in the clouds and saw the city in the clear sky with the sun beaming down. Machu Picchu definitely deserves its status as one of the seven wonders of the world!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arequipa, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Being Peruvian means to come from the farthest place possible to get to Europe.

&lt;p&gt;“Being Peruvian means to come from the farthest place possible to get to Europe. Peru is the land of the Incas. It was the capital of South America; it was where the Spanish founded their empire and took over the Inca Empire and made it into a colony of Spain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mario Testino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food, drink and Salsa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take us long to discover the food in Peru is insanely good. With its Asian and European influences, plus recipes from the coast, jungle and mountains the wide range of food is delicious. In Arequipa we managed to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294313-d2411118-Reviews-India_Indian_Cuisine-Arequipa_Arequipa_Region.html&quot;&gt;India Indian Cuisine&lt;/a&gt; for a curry. We had naan, rice, curry and beer for £9 and it was better than some of the curries we’ve had home! Not only was the food good but it was also cheap so we managed to eat out everyday and keep within our budget. We also ate at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294313-d2213103-Reviews-Hatunpa-Arequipa_Arequipa_Region.html&quot;&gt;Hatunpa&lt;/a&gt;, a restuarant that bases their dishes on potatoes. They use seven different types of Andean potatoes and the dishes have toppings. Dan went for Lomo Saltado, beef in a wine sauce and I had beef and sausage, basically a bolognese with cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried ‘queso helado’ on the walking tour, translated cheese ice cream. Thankfully, it’s not cheese flavoured, it’s vanilla but the texture was like cheese, which is where its name comes from. Of course we had our fair share of Pisco Sours, THE Peruvian drink. We went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://museodelpisco.org/&quot;&gt;Museo del Pisco&lt;/a&gt; and tried the classic and passionfruit ones. This was followed by more in a bar called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dejavuaqp.com/&quot;&gt;Deja Vu&lt;/a&gt;. We’d been told on the tour that they offer free salsa lessons, intregued we went to catch the end but it was basically two local men dancing with a European and American girl, whilst their boyfriends sat drinking beer. Not really a salsa lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mummy Juanita is a must do if in Arequipa. Juanita isn’t technically a mummy but she’s the best preserved frozen human in the world. We visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsm.edu.pe/museo-santuarios-andinos/&quot;&gt;Museo Santuarios Andinosto&lt;/a&gt; see her for S/20 (£4.50) and spent an hour in the museum.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juanita was discovered in 1996 and is named the ‘Ice Maiden’. She was discovered at the top of  Mount Ampato and is so well preserved as she had been frozen since her death. She is 550 years old as she died between 1450 and 1480; she is a child offering made by the Incas to their Gods. The Incas believed that the mountains were alive and when earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occurred, the Gods were punishing them. They believed in reciprocation, therefore they thought if they made offerings to the Gods, the Gods in turn would take care of them. The Inca King in Cusco, made the decision about giving an offering and selected the purest and most beautiful children to sacrifice to the Gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juanita was from the Lake Titicaca area of the Inca Empire and she was around 13 years old when she was offered. The Incas walked to the top of the mountain the king had chosen to make the sacrifice to. They gave Juanita coco leaves and corn beer with some hallucagenic drugs so she became intoxicated, she was then killed by the priest with a blow to the head from a mace. We could still see the holes in her head from the blow. The guide in the museum told us that her internal organs are perfectly preserved due to being frozen for 550 years. We also got lucky as Juanita is moved to the dark for 4 months of the year for preservation reasons but she had been brought back out the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El Misti &amp;#x26; Colca Canyon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Christ the Redeemer, the iconic El Misti remained hidden behind clouds for most of our time in Arequipa. On our last afternoon we went up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Las-Terrazas-Hotel-Arequipa-332723616780517/&quot;&gt;Tereazas Arequipa&lt;/a&gt; for a beer and a good view of the plaza. We were going to leave but the waiter told us the sun would be setting and that it is beautiful when it happens. We were easily convinced to stay for a second beer and not only was the sunset stunning over the Plaza de Armas but the clouds also cleared and we finally managed to get a good view of El Misti.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arequipa is surrounded by active volcanos, El Misti is only 15km away and is 5,822 metres high. It lies between mount Chachani and Pichu Pichu volcano. Its last eruption was in 1985. Both El Misti and Chachani can be climbed in a day but as the weather was cloudy and we were saving our energy for Machu Picchu we decided to give the climb a miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colca Canyon had always been on our itinerary until we arrived in Arequipa. We only had time for a day tour due to our trip which was already booked to Machu Picchu. However it was a 3AM pick up followed up a 4-5 hour drive to the Colca Canyon. The weather was also bad which reduces visibility of the canyon and the chances of seeing the Andean Condor. People who had gone said it was better to do the trip ourselves, to stay 2-3 nights and trek around the canyon. In the end we decided against it and slept in and drank pisco instead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;San Camilo Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d heard people rave about Arequipa’s huge San Camilo Market, however we were pretty disappointed. We’re not sure what we were expecting but apart from one row of fresh brightly coloured fruit the market was pretty average; it actually reminded us of the one at the Bullring in Birmingham. It didn’t seem that big and apart from some smoothie stalls the rest was unrefridgerated meat, which is enough to make anyone contemplate being vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;White City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a walking tour in Arequipa but it was awful. The guide spoke really fast and seemed pretty disinterested in what he was talking out. One of the only things we learned was why Arequipa is called the ‘White City’, initially it was because so many white Europeans settled there and the European influence in the city is really evident. At times we felt like we were walking round a city in the Mediterranean. Today it’s known as the ‘White City’ due to the white bricks they use to build with that come from the nearby volcanoes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plaza de Armas was definitely the best part of the city. It was huge and had a colourful garden in the middle, although sadly the fountain was under restoration. The streets surrounding the Plaza were cobbled and made of the same white stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yanahuara&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was supposed to be a good viewpoint of the city in Yanahuara. We had a wander and there were some arches with a plaza and a white church. The view was alright but we weren’t so high up and the volcanoes were hidden by clouds. In the end we actually had better views watching the sunset over Plaza de Armas. However, walking round the Yanahuara neighbourhood was a good way to pass the morning, we saw loads of classic VW Beetles and Dan managed to catch part of a local football game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Llamas and Alpacas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llama’s are really important to Peruvians and are part of people’s history; before the mule LLamas were used for transportation and helped the Inca’s conquer the area. The wool of Llamas, Alpacas, Vicuñas and Guanacos are used for clothes and Llama leather is used to make shoes and bags. We saw loads of these animals all over Arequipa city. We also visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mundoalpaca.com.pe/&quot;&gt;Mundo Alpaca&lt;/a&gt;, where we were able to pet them and get up close, the fluffy alpacas are still our favourites!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Arequipa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used our four days in Arequipa mainly to chill out and mill around the city, something we hadn’t done for what felt like weeks! We loved the beautiful architecture in the city and at times it felt like we were in the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lake Titicaca, Bolivia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Local communities believe that the shape of the lake depicts that of a puma hunting the rabbit.

Thus the name, Titicaca, comes from the word “Titi Khar’ka” meaning Rock of the Puma in Aymara (a local indigenous language).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Isla Del Sol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked this excursion for convenience with Bolivia Hop so that we could leave Copacabana the same day. The boat picked us up at 13:00 and after an hour or so we were dropped off an a remote pier on Isla Del Sol. We were told the hike was around an hour to Yumani pier, where the boat would pick us back up. The driver offered no explanation or history of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we climbed up the steep steps, we first saw some Inca ruins. The Inca’s believed that the sun god was born on this island, hence the name Isla Del Sol, or island of the sun. There are no roads or vehicles on the island and 800 families live there. Their main income is farming, followed by fishing and tourism. We saw some women and children on our hike along the island, they had Llama’s and asked if we wanted to pay for photos. The best part of the island were the fantastic views of Lake Titicaca and other nearby islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Puno&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were initially going to do a day trip from Puno to Isla Uros and Taquile Island. However, after a day in Copacabana we didn’t get to Puno until 21:00 and the trips collected at 06:00. So, we decided to use Puno as an opportunity for some rest in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huaytusivepuno.com/&quot;&gt;Huaytusive Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, following a tough few days in Bolivia and we opted for a half day trip to Islas Flotantes De Los Uros.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a wander around Puno which is at 3,827 metres, but it is quite small and there wasn’t a lot to see. We were just about ready to stomach some beers again, so  we headed to a bar to watch the Liverpool vs Roma Champions League Semi Final, first leg. The game did not disappoint despite the best attempts of the staff at the bar, faffing with the televisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islas Flotantes De Los Uros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a trip to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uru_people&quot;&gt;Islas Flotantes De Los Uros&lt;/a&gt; or the floating islands with our hotel as it was only S./25 (£5.60). It was very odd as we were rushed away by a woman into a taxi to the port. We were then handed over to a guy who walked us to the boat where everybody was waiting for us. The guide spoke in both English and Spanish but we couldn’t hear him very well due to the boat engine and his monotonous voice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived to one of the islands there was a little boy waiting for us with his football, so as soon as we jumped off the boat and onto the island we had a quick kick around while we waited for the group to congregate. We never thought that we’d play football in the middle of a lake on a bunch of reeds. It was at this point that we took note upon how fascinating the islands actually were and how the islands seemed to move with the water and our footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were introduced to an Uru family who lived on the small island and the young male explained that the islands were constructed by numerous layers of criss-crossed reeds that grow in the shallows of the lake. He then proceeded to show us where they slept before selling us a couple of Llama key rings and a balsa boat ride to Isla Capital. The young Uros man referred to his boat as a ‘Mercedez Benz’. The boat was also made out of reeds and was pushed along by a speed boat as the little boy with his football sang ‘Row row row your boat’.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Isla Captial had a shop and a restaurant, with some signs about where we couldn’t walk. The guide explained that every footstep causes the islands to sink a little bit which means that more reeds need to be placed and repairs made. It seemed that Uros people had a tough job of balancing tourism and the maintenance of the island itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bolivia Hop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We opted for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boliviahop.com/&quot;&gt;Bolivia Hop&lt;/a&gt; due to the convenience of having everything sorted with minimal effort, but with hindsight we wish we had just sorted it ourselves. The La Paz to Puno leg of the journey seemed OK and was efficient, including the crossing of the Tiquina Lake. However, the overnight journey from Puno to Arequipa was particularly uncomfortable. The bus was absolutely boiling, there was limited leg room and the jerky driving led to a terrible night sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Lake Titicaca&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a pleasant few days at Lake Titicaca and enjoyed our rest in the surroundings, particularly after coming out of the busy La Paz. The highlight was undoubtably the unusual Islas Flotantes De Los Uros.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Paz, Bolivia]]></title><description><![CDATA[“The chicken that we eat is chock-full of feminine hormones.

&lt;p&gt;“The chicken that we eat is chock-full of feminine hormones. So, when men eat these chickens, they deviate from themselves as men.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evo Morales, Bolivian President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transport and Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took an overnight bus from Uyuni to La Paz with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.transomar.com/es/&quot;&gt;Trans Omar&lt;/a&gt;. This was an awful company, once everyone was on and the bus was full they let locals on. As there were no seats left they were left standing and sitting on the stairs. The bus was supposed to stop once in Oruro but it stopped around 3-4 times. The doors didn’t close properly either so it was freezing cold! The only plus was that they had been flexible in allowing us to travel the next day and for some reason we’d been upgraded for free from a semi-cama to a cama, which was much more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus arrived in La Paz at 05:30 so we jumped in a taxi and headed to the hotel praying that we could check in as soon as we got there and continue sleeping. We were in luck &lt;a href=&quot;http://cruz-de-los-andes-hostel.lapazhotelsweb.com/en/&quot;&gt;Cruz de Los Andes&lt;/a&gt; was pretty empty so we were able to check in and pass out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El Mercado de las Brujas and La Hechiceria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a day less in La Paz, following the extended stay in Uyuni, we headed out for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redcapwalkingtours.com/en&quot;&gt;walking tour&lt;/a&gt;. We had already seen and been grossed out by, the llama foetuses hanging up outside the shops in El Mercado de las Brujas and La Hechiceria or the ‘Witches Market’ near our hostel. Our guide took us inside a shop run by a witch doctor or yatiri, to explain more about Bolivian beliefs and witchcraft.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide explained that people of the Andes believe that they must make a sacrifice to the goddess Pachamama (Mother Earth) when they build something, as the land is not theirs it belongs to Pachamama. They believe that bad things will happen if they keep taking from Pachamama without giving anything; these beliefs go back to the Incas. So for example, when Bolivians build a house they bury a Llama fetus in the foundations of the house as an offering to Pachamama. In return Pachamama will ensure that their house is strong and no one is hurt during construction. Our guide asked what we thought people might sacrifice if they were going to build a 30 story building as a Llama foetus would not be a big enough offering. One of the group jokingly said a person but it turns out he was correct! The guide explained that it isn’t known fact, more of a myth, but when big buildings in La Paz are demolished human remains are found in the foundations. He added that people will talk about this ‘myth’ but no one will admit to being part of it. He explained that a special shaman who is said to have been struck by lightening, therefore he has died and been reborn, will find a ‘forgotten man’ such as a homeless alcoholic. It is said that the shaman will then give the man 96% alcohol until he passes out and he is buried alive in the foundations of the building. The guide told us that they face the man down so that his soul cannot come up for revenge. So creepy!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He showed us some other things the local people believe. He told us how they make other types of offerings to Pachamama, using paper and sugar, and bury it for something they would like that year e.g. a car or good crops. He also talked about some of the potions that they use in Bolivia; a love potion which you blow on the neck of the person you fancy and a punishing potion which will make someone your ‘slave’, by adding three drops of the potion to their drink. Sounds a little like a date rape drug to us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;San Pedro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met the walking tour in Plaza San Pedro in the centre of the city. The guide pointed to a building metres away from us and told us that it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro_prison&quot;&gt;San Pedro prison&lt;/a&gt;. We were stunned that there was a prison right in the centre of the city and it really didn’t look like one - no barbed wire, no guard towers, nothing. We were told that there are only ten guards who patrol the outside of the building, there are none inside. Families live in the prison and the children can be seen in the morning coming out to go to their school, on the other side of the square. This seemed unbelieveable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide told us that the prison is infamously corrupt; prisoners have to rent their cells from $10 per month to $1000, they have to pay an entrance fee and the guards used to be bribed so that tourists could have a guided tour in the prison. However, he said since the release of the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Marching-Powder-Friendship-Americas-Strangest/dp/0312330340&quot;&gt;‘Marching Powder’&lt;/a&gt;, this has stopped. I really recommend reading this (since La Paz, I’ve downloaded it and can’t put it down). It’s about a British man, Thomas McFadden, and his experiences whilst he was imprisoned in San Pedro for four years for smuggling cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide explained that Bolivia is now the second top country for making cocaine, after Colombia and the purest cocaine in the world used to be made in San Pedro. We were told that the people inside used to get it out by wrapping it in dirty nappies and throwing it onto the street from the roof. We asked why people don’t escape if the conditions are so poor and with such low security. The guide explained that the prisoners have their families living there with them, they own and run businesses on the inside, and he explained that if people are caught escaping they are sent away to a maximum security prison. This works as a deterrent and people remain in San Pedro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cholitas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In La Paz, supermarkets appeared to be non-existant. Instead, fruit, meat, toiletries and anything else we could think of were sold in markets through the streets of the city. It was mainly women selling the produce and most wore big skirts and bowler hats. Our guide explained they are ‘Cholita’s’. The term comes from the word ‘Chola’ which actually means mixed-race or ‘civilised Indian’ and is regarded as a racist term. The word has been changed in South America adding ‘ita’ at the end to make it a more endearing and to be called Cholita as a badge of honour, as one is born Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cholita’s wear big puffy skirts to make their hips looks bigger which is a sign of fertility. Their skirts come down to their ankles and the guide explained that this is to cover the sexiest part of the Cholitas body, her calves. He told us that their bowler hats came from the British men who were working on the railway in Bolivia in the 1900’s, they ordered some that were too small for the men so sold them to the women. He explained if it’s worn on the top the Cholita is taken, if it’s on the side then she is single.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cholita Wrestling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redcapwalkingtours.com/en/activity/78024/cholita-wrestling&quot;&gt;Cholita Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; takes place in La Paz on Thursday and Sunday. As we were there on a Sunday we thought we’d give it go as it was only $13USD (£9) including transport, snacks and a drink. It’s inspired by America’s WWE and Mexico’s Lucha Libre, so we knew it would be fake. We’d read that there was lots of spitting and throwing food, so we also knew it would be a little crass. There were five fights in total, the first was men, the next three were Cholitas and finally another male fight. The storylines were obvious good guy vs. bad guy, but what took us by surprise was that one of the male referees got involved as a bad guy. At times it was uncomfortable to watch him kick and hit the Cholitas but the Cholitas were fearless and faught back. In the end he ran out of the hall with people throwing things at him and calling him all sorts of names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We read about the origins of Cholita Wrestling a little more afterwards and found that it was initially set up as a way for women in Bolivia who had been domestically abused, to let out their stresses and frustrations. Since 2011, the Cholita’s have a female run associations such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/100569187&quot;&gt;The Flying Cholitas&lt;/a&gt;, and write the wrestling themselves. Cholita Wrestling is a way for Bolivian women to prove their worth in a ‘man’s world’ and they feel it gives them equal footing to men. Wrestling also provides the female working-class a way to earn money from both tourists and local’s alike.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the locals took it really seriously, the kids were at the barriers trying to get signatures and they were throwing popcorn and food at the ‘bad guys’; shouting and jeering at them. During the last two fights the wrestlers came out of the ring and barriered part and were basically fighting between people. At the end we got a picture with the Cholitas and Dan brought a green shiny mask for £2.50. Cholita Wrestling turned out to be pretty entertaining, although possibly the most bizarre thing we’ve ever seen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolivia is a socialist country who absolutely hate America. Our guide told us that in 2003 their former President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada robbed the city bank and took off in a helicopter in amongst a crossfire. This was following protests surrounding an economic crisis and the ‘gas war’. He showed us the bullet holes in the buildings in the Plaza near the President’s House and told us Lozada now lives in exile in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their current president Evo Morales is now in his third term of Presidency of the country. We looked him up after the tour and he’s made some very strange comments. For example, he told the Bolivian people that Coca-Cola causes baldness and eating chicken causes homosexuality. He has also introduced a benefit for young parents which is encouraging young women to have babies; he introduced this following protests after he tried to ban the use of condoms in order to populate the country. Bolivia is a poor country and many of the people are illiterate and uneducated, the guide explained that this means people are easily manipulated. He told us that the government in the country use distraction techniques, so at one point the Bolivian Government decided they were going to make all the clocks backwards as the country is in the southern hemisphere. This led the people to protest about this and ignore the real problems in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d also heard a lot about Chile and Bolivia’s relationship in both countries. From the Chilean side, we found out that they won the War of the Pacific over 100 years ago and claimed the Antofagasta territory, land rich in minerals which used to belong to Peru and Bolivia. This meant Bolivia became a landlocked country and they lost their access to the ocean. People in Chile say that they offered Bolivia use of a port with no taxes but they don’t use it. The matter is now in an international court as Bolivia wish to negotiate and want their land and access to the sea back. Bolivia’s view is that this will help their economy and their country and Chilean’s don’t believe this will fix Bolivia’s problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El Alto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Alto is a neighbouring city to La Paz up on the hills. We’d heard about a big flea market there on a Sunday which sells everything we could think of; as its up on the hills, there is also great views of La Paz. We decided to go up in the red cable car as it only took ten minutes (after a 45 minute queue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market was insanely busy and anything that had been lost, stolen or broken in La Paz was being sold in El Alto market. You could buy remote controls, light fittings, car parts, odd shoes, teddies, the list goes on. We’d been warned not to stray too far away from the cable car station as tourists get mugged in El Alto but somewhere in the market we’d heard people could buy animals and be seen by a shaman. We didn’t venture round for long as there wasn’t really anything there for us to buy but we enjoyed the view of the city on the way down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdict on La Paz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Paz was the strangest place we had visited so far. From San Pedro prison, the Cholita Wrestling and their unusual sacrificial beliefs. It was quite a grim and dirty place and we both got sick in our time here. In the end, we felt like Bolivia was out to get us and we were very excited for our next destination, Peru!!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Salar de Uyuni, the Salt Flats We were so undecided about whether or not to cross the salt flats for three days from San Pedro in Chile to…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//salar-de-uyuni/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//salar-de-uyuni/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Salar de Uyuni, the Salt Flats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were so undecided about whether or not to cross the salt flats for three days from San Pedro in Chile to Uyuni in Bolivia. Before we left the UK we did a lot of research which included reading nightmare reviews about drunk drivers, broken jeeps, no seatbelts, bad food and people generally having a horrible time. This was of course in between people saying they’d had a blast. When we arrived in Chile we contemplated not doing it and looked into getting a bus from San Pedro to Uyuni and then doing a day tour to Salar de Uyuni. But this meant missing much of the Bolivian countryside; in particular Laguna Colorada and the pink flamingos. We spoke to friends who had travelled to South America and each had had very different experiences on their three day tours of the salt flats but both told us we had to do it. After a lot more research we booked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldwhitetravel.com/&quot;&gt;White World Travel&lt;/a&gt;; they seemed to have the best most recent reviews on Tripadvisor. We paid £138 each all inclusive; a lot of money to gamble for a good driver and a good jeep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day one&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crossing the border&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were picked up by mini bus from our hostel at 7:40, even though we’d been told 7; not a great start. In around 45 minutes we’d arrived at the Chilean side of the border to be stamped out of the country. We saw the two volcanoes, Licancabur and Juriques up close whilst we were queuing. The Bolivian side of the border was a small shack surrounded by jeeps from all of the different tour companies in San Pedro. Everyone from World White Travel was split up into three jeeps as each one held six passengers and we were lucky to have a great group; a German couple, a girl from the US and an Italian guy. Our driver was called Hugo, he gave us breakfast, wrapped everyone’s backpacks up in tarpaulin and tied them to the roof of the jeep.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we were off, it was pretty evident everyone was a little nervous about what the next three days might entail. Hugo went to the effort of learning our names and told us to tell him if we had headaches from the altitude as he had a bag of coca leaves for us to chew on to relieve the symptoms. He was very attentive and gave a good explanation at each stop during the three day tour. This was in Spanish of course but the bits we didn’t get everyone else in the jeep was able to translate, as they could all speak 2-3 languages. After a short drive we arrived at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Avaroa_Andean_Fauna_National_Reserve&quot;&gt;Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve&lt;/a&gt; and paid out 150BOB (£15.50) entrance fee for the next three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Laguna Blanca and Laguna Verde&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo drove straight past Laguna Blanca, we’re not sure if this is because he didn’t like the lake, we were running late or it was to over take all the other jeeps but either way we headed straight to Laguna Verde. This was supposed to be a bright green lake but Hugo explained that this only happens depending on the wind distrubing the sediments in the water. It was at the base of the Licancabur volcano, so we managed to capture a decent photo of the lake with the volcano in the background before we made our way to the next stop.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dali Desert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way we saw a culpeo fox (or Andean fox), Hugo slowed down so we could get a photo through the windows of the jeep. Soon after we arrived at the Salvador Dali Desert. It’s named this because it looks like the landscapes in Salvador Dali’s paintings, despite the name he never went there. We stopped for a few photo’s and the landscape was very orange or burnt red. We didn’t stay long before driving off to the next stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sol de Mañana&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a geothermal field, the name means morning sun in Spanish. We were told to mind our step but allowed to walk between the bubbling pits of mud lakes and steam pools which were up to 150-200C. It smelt like sulphur and we were in a seismically active area so we hoped there wouldn’t be an earthquake as we were walking along the thin ridges between the boiling pools of mud! At this point we were 4,900m high; the highest we’d go. We’d started to get headaches from the altitude and our bags of crisps were filled with air and looked like they would pop! Sol de Mañana was beautiful and looked like it was from another world. This was one of our favourite landscapes during the three day tour.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thermal Pools in Polques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thermal pools were more of a photo opportunity for ^BOB (60p) than a relaxing soak in hot water. It was around 28C and we were told not to stay in the thermal pool for more than fifteen minutes due to the possibility of the altitude making us feel light headed when we got out. The water was warm and the sun was shining, but the sides of the pool were really slimey. Apparently the high content of minerals in the water can relieve the symptoms of arthritis and rheumatism but it seemed to us to be more of a tourist stop on the way to the salt flats. We stayed in for about ten minutes and it was relaxing to be in the hot water after weeks of temperamental showers and no baths in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Laguna Colorada&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some bangers and mash for lunch at the hostel, we headed to Laguna Colorada which was incredible! It was a massive lake that looks pink/red caused by red sediments and pigmentation of some of the algae in the lake. It also has white borax islands which contrast with the red of the water and the green grass, making the lake look multicoloured. There were hundreds of James Flamingos in the lake and we saw some grey baby ones! We had an hour to wander around the lake, which we did slowly due to being short of breath from the altitude.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we arrived at our first basic hostel; Huayllajara. It was a concrete room with six concrete platforms and a mattress on top. We were provided with loads of blankets and an extra sleeping bag. We’d been told that as we were sleeping at 4100m it could get really cold between -2 and -5 and of course there was no heating as we were in the middle of nowhere. We had some Mate and some time to chill, no one dared to use the shower as there was only cold water. After a three course meal, which was probably some of the best food we’d eaten since we’d been away; vegetable soup, spaghetti bolognese and fruit, we put on all of our layers and went to bed at 20:30 as we had to be up at 06:00 the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternative route&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly we were all really warm during the night and had to remove layers; we’re not sure if it had been milder, or if it was because there were six bodies in the room but none of us had really felt the cold. On the second day we were supposed to be visiting a stone tree, three lakes and a small salt flat before heading to the Salt Hostel for our second night. However after the jeep was loaded Hugo said that we could do the alternative route with one of the other jeeps. He said two jeeps had to go together and there would be less lakes, more rocks and lots of llamas. Everyone seemed keen to do the alternative route but Dan and I remained suspicious about the drivers motives for taking us on a path not offered by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route started off-road and we noticed how careful Hugo was when he was driving. He would follow the newer paths with less rocks and he drove slower than the other jeep that had come with us on the alternative route. It was very reassuring after all of the reviews we had read about dangerous driving!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Laguna Capina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was the entrance to Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve, where we had to show the tickets we purchased the day before. There were no toilets here so we had to make the most of mother nature. We then headed to Laguna Capina, this was a lake near some Borax mines. There were no flamingos here and the lake was a bit dried up. We also stopped at another lake not too much further along the road. There were more flamingos here but it was nothing in comparison to Laguna Colorada. We took a few pictures and then got back in the jeep and headed towards the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rock tree &amp;#x26; Lost city of Italy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo wasn’t lying when he said there was lots of rocks on this route. We first stopped at a rock tree, formed from volcanic lava. Then we stopped at a couple of rocks that looked like a face and a teapot. Finally we went to Italia Perdida, Hugo explained that the rocks here were found by an Italian guy on a motorbike who said they looked like his village in Italy, hence where its name comes from. We saw a small Inca house here and a hole in the rocks, a similar shape to Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped at Laguna Negra for lunch; rice, tuna and lots of salad. Hugo walked us firstly over some marsh land which had llamas grazing on it. They were decorated with colourful earrings and occasionally looked up to see what was going on. The lake was surrounded by rocks; we climbed up some to get a good view of Laguna Negra. The water in the lake was really dark so there were really good reflections in the water. Apart from the clicking of cameras the lake was really peaceful and we spent some time relaxing here, until a guy got out his drone. The buzzing was awful and ruined the ambience of the lake. We also saw a Vischacha which is a rabbit like creature belonging to the chinchilla family. They were scuttling along the rocks but were way to quick for me to snap on my camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Anaconda Canyon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again we were told to be careful as we clambered over rocks to a viewpoint of the canyon; basically a big rock hanging over the edge. It was a big drop and neither of us ventured too close to the edge! The canyon snaked around and Hugo had explained this is where it got it’s name from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Salt Flat Chiguana&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a small salt flat not far from our second hostel. It wasn’t as white as the Salar de Uyuni but it was a good place to practice some of our persepctive photos. It was here we realised that ‘drone guy’ was in the other jeep as it only took a few minutes before the peaceful countryside was being ruined by an inssessent buzzing again. There was a railway line crossing through the salt flats which used to transport minerals to Chile from Bolivia’s mines. The surroundings were beautiful with big volcanoes such as one called Ollague which we later learned is still active.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Salt Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second night was spent in a salt hostel. The bricks, tables and benches were made from salt and there was salt all over the floor; which was super impractical! We were able to have a hot shower here and had chicken and chips for dinner! Whilst Dan was showering, I went for a wander around the village along the dusty roads and found the remains of the jaw of a llama with its teeth intact just lying in the road. I watched the sun go down behind the hill and the moon come out before heading back for Mate. After dinner Hugo brought us a bottle of wine to share and told us we needed to be ready by 05:10 in the morning to catch the sunrise at the saltflats. Again we were in bed by 20:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Salar de Uyuni&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were up at 04:30 and ready to get the to highest and largest salt flats in the world. It took around an hour from the salt hostel, on the way Hugo explained that 50% of the worlds lithium comes from the Bolivian salt flats, which is used to make batteries. Hugo drove to the wet part which had a good mirror reflection once the sun came up! Later he and the other driver were trying to work out he best route through it, as it looked pretty deep. Some of the other jeeps had driven into it and we could see people standing on top of the jeeps to watch the sunrise. We were quite pleased that Hugo had remained on the dry ground as we would have had to have stood in the wet salt flat bare foot in knee deep water. Watching the sun come up was incredible and we got loads of great photos!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then drove to Incahuasi, meaning house of the inca’s, which is an island of cacti in the middle of the salt flats. It used to be at the top of a volcano. Hugo told us that the salt on the flats is 26m deep and that they formed from prehistoric lakes. We had a wander round the giant cacti before having breakfast. These were huge and Hugo had told us that some of them were around 900 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo then drove us to the dry part of the salt flats where there is no horizon line for ‘photo loco’. He was really good and took group photos for us using props - including with a dinosaur, pringles tub and coke cup. He then let us have some time taking our own pictures. One of the guys from the other jeep decided to strip off completely for his photo on the salt flats which was hilarious as the drone was out again trying to get a peep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Train cemetery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few more stops before we reached Uyuni. We stopped at the banderas, an island of flags; we managed to find the Union Jack! There was also a ‘Dakar Bolivia’ monument and a Salar and Llama Museum which we opted out of. The last stop was a Train Cemetery. Basically a load of rusty trains that we were able to climb in and over. It was founded in 1889 and built by the British; Uyuni used to be a bustling railway city connecting Bolivia’s mines to the rest of the Pacific. However, the mines dried up and the trains stopped running; rather than sell the trains for scrap they left them to rot. We had some time to climb over them and take photo’s which was probably a little dangerous but it made for a great photo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Bolivia’s version of Chorillana for lunch we emptied the jeep and said goodbye to Hugo. We were due to get a night bus to La Paz at 20:00 however just as we got to Uyuni, Dan was violently sick so we decided to stay the night. We had little choice looking for a last minute deal for a private room and bathroom but went with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g317033-d8309662-Reviews-Hostal_Castillo_de_Lilianna-Uyuni_Potosi_Department.html&quot;&gt;Hostel Castillo de Liliana&lt;/a&gt;. The decor in the hostel was like it had come from the 1970’s and the room was really dingy. The kitchen was filthy and it was freezing cold. We couldn’t wait to leave and compared to the rest of Bolivia, Uyuni was really pricey! After a night and day nursing Dan back to good health we hit the road and caught our overnight bus to La Paz a day later than planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on the Salar de Uyuni&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reviews of the tours for Salar de Uyuni are very mixed and there are hundreds of companies to choose from. Each one has good and bad jeeps and good and bad drivers so really it’s pot luck. We got really lucky with White World Travel and our driver, Hugo. We ended up having the most amazing three days driving through the Bolivian countryside which was definitely the highlight of our trip so far!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[San Pedro de Atacama, Chile]]></title><description><![CDATA[“What makes the desert beautiful is that somewhere it hides a well.” Antoine de Saint-Exupery.

&lt;p&gt;“What makes the desert beautiful is that somewhere it hides a well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antoine de Saint-Exupery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walking Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long lie in on our first day in San Pedro de Atacama, as we do, we decided to go on a walking tour! San Pedro de Atacama is a small town built around an oasis in the desert so we weren’t really sure what there would be to see. We went with &lt;a href=&quot;https://tours4tips.com/san-pedro-de-atacama/&quot;&gt;Tours4Tips&lt;/a&gt; and the only building we saw was a clay church. But it wasn’t the sites, it was the stories that made the walking tour interesting. Our favourite story was about the belief of the afterlife of the Likan-antai people, the indigenous people to the Atacama desert. The guide told us that the Likan-antai people used to put their dead in big ceramic pots with their animals, usually their dogs, and position them facing the sky. The story was told that the animal would take the soul of the dead to the Moon. They believed that the Moon was female, due to links with the Moon’s cycle. Then in three months time a new star would be born so that their loved ones could watch over them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great story from the Likan-antai people was about the volcanoes that can be seen from the town on the border of Bolivia. The two volcanoes are called Licancabur and Juriques. The story goes that Licancabur was in love with a mountain called Mount Quimal. She loved him back as he was big and strong. However, Licancabur’s brother Juriques was jealous and persisted for Mount Quimals love. When Licancabur found out he became very angry, exploded and decapitated his brother. Licancabur and Jurique’s father found out and moved Mount Quimal away from them, he made the two brothers live side by side for the rest of eternity. The guide told us that one day a year at sunrise and sunset, Licancabur and Quimal’s shadows are long enough to reach one another and for this day only they are able to share their love once more. He also added that on this day people in San Pedro celebrate love, which often results in more babies being born 9 months after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Astronomy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deliberated over paying for an astronomy tour as we thought we’d probably see some decent starry nights on our two night tour of the Salt Flats from San Pedro de Atacama to Uyuni in Bolivia. There was also a huge variation in price and in reviews. In the end we went with cheap and cheerful and we weren’t disappointed. We were driven to what looked like someone’s backyard outside of the town so there was no light pollution. We were also lucky as it was a new Moon so the sky was really dark and the stars were bright. The guide, Alex, showed us a video and explained about nebulas and supernovas; this all went over our heads. He got out his telescopes and showed us Jupiter, Belleguese, Sirius, the butterfly nebula and some other stars and constellations in the sky. He explained that the stars that twinkle the most are the ones that are closest to the horizon because the light has further to travel over the earth’s atmosphere. As we were having our picture taken, we were also lucky enough to see a ‘shooting star’ or meteor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Valle de la Luna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had seen some of Valle de la Luna on the way to San Pedro from the airport and it didn’t seem too far away, so rather than pay for a tour we decided to explore for ourselves. Clearly we’d forgotten the trauma we experienced in Bariloche. We rented bikes from the town, which came with helmets, puncture repair kits, lights and a pump. We told the guy that we wanted to do Valle de la Luna and Valle de la Muerte. He told us that this would take around eight hours; five hours at Valle de la Luna and three at Valle de la Muerte. We thought he was exaggerating to get us to pay for the full day of the bikes, which we planned to do anyway so we could take our time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We were expecting a few rocks that looked a bit like the Moon to be just off the road, but of course this wasn’t the case. We had approximately an 6km bike ride out of town to the entrance of Valle de la Luna. Once we got there and paid our entrance fee pf $2500CLP (£2.80) we realised what we had let ourselves in for. It was 5km to the actual entrance and there was loads to see there, caves, canyons, dunes, rocks and a mine. In the end we did a 34km bike ride from San Pedro all around Valle de la Luna, plus the short hikes to see the sites.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the entrance to Valle de la Luna the road turned to gravel which made the ride really bumpy, it also became hilly. So much so that we had to push the bikes to the top rather than ride them. It didn’t help that the gears were terrible too, however, it was fun sitting on them and just holding onto the breaks going down. We decided to complete the trecherous bike ride to the end of the road and then on our way back enjoy the sites.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscape was out of this world, parts of it looked just like a film set for a film about landing on the Moon or Mars. The caves were really dark and low but wide, we had to make sure we stepped over the dogs who were chilling in the shade there. We climbed a few miradors for the views but it was really hot with no shade. We noticed the air was really dry and it gave us sore throats; before we made it back we’d also got through 4 litres of water! We managed to bike and look round Valle de la Luna in six hours, by which time we were in no state to go to Valle de la Muerte, so had to give it a miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Hostal-Casa-Greda-1572027869532954/&quot;&gt;Hostal Casa Greda&lt;/a&gt; and it was the best hostel we had been in so far. Considering how dusty the roads were it was immaculately clean. The family who run the hostel pottered around making sure we had everything we needed and in the morning left us not only breakfast, but a sandwich and snacks for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on San Pedro de Atacama&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We originally just thought of San Pedro as a hub to get across the salt flats from Chile, however it was so much more than that and we wish we had stayed longer, as there were so many things we weren’t able to see or do. We loved this little clay town in the middle of the desert!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Santiago, Chile]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Laughter is the language of the soul.” Pablo Neruda.

&lt;p&gt;“Laughter is the language of the soul.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pablo Neruda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bus Journey &amp;#x26; Border Crossing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive from Mendoza to Santiago was the most picturesque journey we’d had so far, with stunning views of the Andes as we passed over and between the mountains. As were on the upper level of the bus we became quite nervous at the sheer drop as the bus snaked along the trails down the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the border crossing, we were puzzled to see a Chile flag as all other bus journeys we had taken, stopped at the border control of the country we were leaving to stamp our passports first. In Brazil, we had overheard some people saying that they had huge fines when trying to re-enter countries that they had left without getting a stamp. When we told the bus driver he shrugged it off and said we didn’t need a stamp and when we queried it with an older Brazilian man, he told us that Argentina doesn’t care! If we ever come back to Argentina, hopefully they won’t care then either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having thrown on our big and small backpacks once we arrived in Santiago, looking like turtles, we navigated ourselves onto a main road. We were immediately met with the hustle and bustle of the busy streets as vendors shouted desperately trying to get anyone to buy their fake nike trainers or dog coats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After squeezing onto the metro, around 45 minutes later we arrived at the stop closest to the hostel. Due to the hustle and bustle earlier, we were relieved to walk through a peaceful and clean suburbian area and arrive at our hostel, Parron de Colores, just off a street called Coventry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earthquake&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning following our arrival, Sophie was woken by the room shaking and clattering of the windows. She in turn woke me up; apparently there was an earthquake. We later found out that it had a magnitude of 6.6 and its epicentre was in a nearby city. Our walking tour guide told us that anything above a 7 occuring within Santiago would have the capability to cause damage, so we were glad it wasn’t any closer. All it really did was open the window a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Museum of Memory and Human Rights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide from the walking tour recommended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-memory-and-human-rights&quot;&gt;Museum of Memory and Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the genocide from the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile from 1973 to 1990. Although the museum was free, we were told at the entrance that it was all in Spanish but we could pay for an English audio guide, which we opted against. Fortunately, we found that the numerous videos were subtitled in English and there were some translated displays dotted around so we were able to get a good understanding of each area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military dictatorship in Chile was something we both knew very little about and we were glad we took some time to learn about this period in recent history. The museum was informative, moving and shocking across the diplays. There was a particular section that still haunts us, which was about the ways in which the soldiers tortured and interrogated the accused political prisoners. There was even a ‘how to’ guide with diagrams showing how to perform various different torture methods which would have been distributed to the soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d recommend anybody to research about this period of history, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship_of_Chile_(1973%E2%80%9390)&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has a good overview of the events that occurred. When we learned about the involvement and support provided to the military from other countries, such as the USA and the UK, it certainly made us wonder about history repeating itself today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cerro San Cristobal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning we ventured up Cerro San Cristobal via the funicular for views of Santiago in front of the Andes. We climbed up some steps to find a statue of the Virgin Mary which overlooked the city. It wasn’t quite on the same level as Christ the Redeemer, but impressive nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were lucky as the pollution above the city wasn’t too bad so we got to see impressive views at the top and on the teleferico (cable car).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bellavista&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bellavista was definitely our favourite area of Santiago. There was loads of street art, hipster bars and restaurants where we spent an afternoon wandering and came back on an evening for food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walking tour guide explained that, as Santiago was growing, the rich aristocrats who had lived on the other side of the river pushed all of the risque places they didn’t want to taint their reputation over to Bellavista. That wasn’t to say that they didn’t visit! Pablo Neruda who was a famous Chilean poet and politician bought his mistress a house in Bellavista so that he could sneak off and meet her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drink&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the walking tour guide’s recommendation we tried a few drinks down student street, including Piscola (pisco and Coca-Cola) and Terramoto. Terramoto is translated to mean earthquake because it’s said that if you have a few of them, afterwards when you stand up you feel as though the ground is shaking. I only had one so I wasn’t about to experience our second earthquake in Santiago. There are a few variations of Terramoto, but the one I had was made up of a fortified white wine (like Country Manor), pineapple ice cream and a bitter spirit called fernet. Not the best sounding combination but if you’re a student, it’s strong, cheap and a good way to get drunk.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour guide explained that because the coffee was so awful in Chile, noone really drank it until a visionary entrepreneur set up a coffee shop, nicknamed coffee with legs. Customers would go for a really bad coffee served by strippers essentially! The majority of the coffee shops had blacked out windows but the tour guide showed us one that you could peep inside, which we did and it was a very bizarre scene. Young women stood on podeums with short red dresses on talking to and kissing the customers on the cheek goodbye. I starred it on Google Maps but we never went back. The guide told us that that his girlfriend once dragged him to ‘coffee with three legs’ which I don’t think needs any further explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free Walking Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can probably tell with all the mentions of the walking tour at &lt;a href=&quot;https://freetoursantiago.cl/portada.html&quot;&gt;Free Tour Santiago&lt;/a&gt;, we thought that the guide Franco was fantastic. Even though the tour lasted 4 hours, it really didn’t feel like that and we were disappointed that it had to end. We even bumped into the “Mayor” of Santiago as we passed his offices who welcomed us to the city. Although later googling showed the mayor to be a woman so maybe we misheard!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide also told us about the Mapuche people in Chile, that they are indiginous people to Chile and there are violent conflicts today going on about their rights. He also told us about Chilean Independence day; that it is the only day where people fight in the street and things can turn violent due to the political differences in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also finally found out what the figures were in Puerto Natales,the naked men that were patterned wearing a mask. The guide told us these are from the Selk’nam people who lived in Patagonia. One of their traditions was that when a boy became a man, the males in the family would paint themselves like this and then try to scare the boy, if he wasn’t frightened then he was a man. The guide recommended going to the Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino to learn more about this, but we ran out of time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Santiago&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both absolutely loved Santiago from the suburban regions, to the hustle and bustle of the city to the hipster, student neighbourhood. So much so, that it was the first place we visited where we could easily see ourselves living. Everyone we spoke to was warm and friendly which was a refreshing change to some of the Argentinean’s we encountered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Valparaiso, Chile]]></title><description><![CDATA[“We are not hippies, we are happies.” Art+Believe.

&lt;p&gt;“We are not hippies, we are happies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art+Believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Street Art&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We travelled to Valparaiso by bus from Santiago which only took a couple of hours. Considering how close the two cities are, they’re very different. Valparaiso is a port city which looks very run down; rubbish on the streets, cracked pavements and crumbling houses. It’s built on the hills so all the streets are disorganised and muddled and every building is a different shape and colour, and most have a mural or graffiti on them. There was so much surrounding us we didn’t know where to look! It took around five minutes for us to fall in love with Valparaiso and to understand why it has the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw absolutely loads of street art by artists such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://anis88.cl/&quot;&gt;Anis&lt;/a&gt;, Un Kolor Distinto, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/daniel.marceli/?hl=en&quot;&gt;Daniel Marceli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/cuelli.mangui/&quot;&gt;Pablo Cuellimangui&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freetourvalparaiso.cl/portada.html&quot;&gt;free walking tour&lt;/a&gt; our guide stopped and spoke to someone who he later told us was his friend, Pablo Cuellimangui. He was carrying his gear to make more art in the city. The guide told us that street art in Valparaiso is a vicious circle, as some of the artists protest against tourism in their art, yet tourists come to see their work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valparaiso was really overwhelming. Sometimes we walked down the same street in opposite directions and it looked completely different, because of the art or the buildings that we noticed. The guide said Valparaiso was full of secrets, that buildings would be shaped like boats, or the underside of steps painted, and that we had to be really paying attention to see all of its charm. It’s a wonder that I only trod in dog poo once with so much to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cerro Alegre &amp;#x26; Cerro Concepcion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explored these two touristic hills on the walking tour. Valparaiso is known for its ‘elevators’ up it’s hills and we rode the Queen Victoria elevator to the top. During the walking tour we met the 97 year old man who helped make the city a world heritage site and visited the oldest brewery in Valparaiso &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cerveceraaltamira.cl/&quot;&gt;Altamira&lt;/a&gt;, where beer was first introduced to the city. The guide also explained to us why Valparaiso is so poor and so different to its neighbouring city Santiago. He explained that Valparaiso was an important port city for the world when ships had to pass around the bottom of South America. But that it became a forgotten city after the Panama Canal was built, as this was a quicker and cheaper route between Europe and Australasia/Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the walking tour, we went with the guides recommendation to see the city from the sea and took a 30 minute boat ride for $3000CLP (£3.50). For the money it was worth it, the boat took us around the port area where we saw a couple of sealions on a buoy and one swimming. We also saw some of the navy ships, got a wave from the captain, saw a submarine and all of the shipping containers being moved in the port.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having researched Valparaiso before we got there, we had read numerous blogs about people being robbed in broad daylight in various parts of the city and that the hills were dangerous for a gringo backpacker to wander around alone. So we decided to splash out a little more for a hostel in the touristic area of Cerro Alegre, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.casaverdelimon.com/hostal_en.html&quot;&gt;Hostal Casa Verde Limon&lt;/a&gt;. It had really high ceilings and its staircases and hallways were muddled, like the rest of Valparaiso. And, just like Rio, our visit to Valparaiso was trouble free. We did end up wandering some of the hills on our own and we never felt threatened at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Doggy Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our walking tour we learned that Chile has one million street dogs and 12,000 of them live in Valparaiso. At the beginning of the tour a chubby golden labrador joined us. The guide told us her name is ‘Pork Chop’ or in the hills they call her ‘Shakira’ because of the way her bum moves as she walks up the hills. She followed us for most of the tour. We’d noticed that some of the dogs barked at people as they walked past but we had remained unscatched, and dogs would just happily follow us around before they found someone more interesting. The guide told us that the dogs in Valparaiso are racist; he explained that they love tourists and only bark at the local people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Empanadas &amp;#x26; Chorrillana&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The empanadas in Argentina had been good but they had absolutely nothing on the empanadas we ate in Chile. We’d read about a place called Le Pato, who do really great baked empanadas. On our first evening in Valpraiso whilst we were exploring the hills, we went on a mission to find Le Pato. It was worth it; Dan had a blood sausage one and I had a veggie and lentil one. They were big and absolutely stuffed full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also went to Delicious Express, the best place for fried empanadas with 80 different types of fillings. We went twice, they were that good! We tried chicken, cheese and pepper and bacon, meat, cheese and onion. The great thing about Delicious Express was that the empanada’s were cooked fresh and were piping hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chorrillana; a traditional Chilean dish. We had been told about this dish on the walking tours in both Santiago and Valparaiso. The one we had at El Pimenton was a layer of apple sauce, a huge layer of fries, covered in beef and onions with three fried eggs on top. Heart attack on a plate. It cost $13500CLP for a double dish for two, which is around £15, possibly the most expensive chips we’ve ever eaten!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Valparaiso&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to cut our time short in Santiago to make some room to visit Valparaiso and we’re so glad we did. It was just our kind of place; chaotic, muddled, gritty and covered in graffiti!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mendoza, Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[“My only regret in life is that I did not drink more wine.” Ernest Hemingway.

&lt;p&gt;“My only regret in life is that I did not drink more wine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernest Hemingway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Chocolate to Wine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our journey from Bariloche to Mendoza was a hardcore twenty hour bus ride. We did some research before we booked; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andesmar.com/en/&quot;&gt;Andesmar&lt;/a&gt; had good reviews so we went with them and booked a cama (bed) for £80. The bus left Bariloche at 13:00 and we arrived in Mendoza the following morning at 08:30. The first interaction we had from a staff member on the bus was around 20:00 when they launched into a very loud game of bingo. At this point we were really thirsty, but at least we could work on our numbers in Spanish. We were finally offered dinner and a drink at 22:30, just 9.5 hours into the journey. If this was a good company we wondered what the others were like!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vino Tinto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason people go to Mendoza is of course for the wine, in particular Argentinan Malbec. As we had been so unsuccessful at navigating around Bariloche ourselves, we decided to book a tour to explore Maipu Valley. We went with a full day biking tour booked through our hostel, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hostel-mora-mendoza.mendoza-hotels-ar.com/en/&quot;&gt;Mora International Hostel&lt;/a&gt; for £30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour itself was a little unbelievable at times; they were over an hour late for pick up, abandoned us for an hour and a half at the first bodega and all the guide really said was ‘vamos!‘. The bikes were another thing altogether. We use the word ‘bikes’ loosely as they had no gears, no breaks and we weren’t given a helmets. They were basically some metal poles welded together with two wheels and the hardest seat in the world to sit on. We had to hobble around with bruised bumcheeks for days after our bumpy bikeride around Maipu. We also thought we’d be biking around the vineyards, but in actual fact we biked the main roads between the vineyards, not so idyllic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the tours in the bodega’s were really interesting; we now know how to taste wine properly, how to tell if its been in an oak barrel and for how long! Proper wine snobbery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first bodega we visited was Bodegas y Vinedos Familia Cecchin Organicos. They explained that they use trees and herbs to distract the insects from eating the grapes rather than chemicals. We tasted three different types of wine, all were delicious. Whilst we were waiting for the guide and driver to return, one of the men working at the vineyard gave us all some Malbec grapes to try before the lorry tipped them in the squisher. The second bodega was Vistandes, here we learned the difference between a young wine, reserve and gran reserve and tasted two more wines.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We biked to the Beer Garden for a pint and empanada for lunch and got talking to a Swiss couple who were finding the tour as amusing as we were. We tried to order a glass of red but despite being in the wine capital of Argentina, surrounded by vineyards, they didn’t have any. After lunch, we made our way to the last Bodega, Dominica. A tour wasn’t offered around the vineyards here, but the guide did teach us how to taste the wine properly and we brought a bottle to enjoy that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mendoza City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a walking tour of the city and the guide told us lots of things we’d have never known otherwise; that the paths and roads are so wide in case of an earthquake and that there are no trees native to Mendoza, they’re all imported from elsewhere. He took us to the main spots in the city, which weren’t really grand at all. After spending so long in cities in Patagonia, which are made for tourists visiting the national parks, it was refreshing to be back in a true Latin American city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a Sunday in Mendoza, and like all other cities we had been to, everything was closed, so we had a picnic in San Martin Park and sunbathed all afternoon. We also headed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.premiumtowersuites.com/mendoza/&quot;&gt;Premium Tower Suites Hotel&lt;/a&gt; to have a coffee in their restuarant on the top floor to enjoy the view. However it was closed to the public due to a private function. We did get a glimpse of Mendoza surrounded by the Andes but not for long enough to get a picture before we were shooed away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last night in Argentina we went for steak in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laluciagrillbar.com.ar/&quot;&gt;La Lucia Bar &amp;#x26; Grill&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t as good as other’s we’d had but it was our last chance for an Argentinan bottle of red and steak. We then headed to Aristides Av., the nightlife hotspot for the university city of Mendoza. We had some beers in Beerlin and Hangar 52, more microbreweries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Mendoza&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason we had added Mendoza to our itinery was for its wine and it did not disappoint. The city itself was a pleasant surprise, it was a slow paced, full of plaza’s and parks and it felt more like Latin America than the last few places we had been to. A great end to our time in Argentina!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[“All you need is love.

&lt;p&gt;“All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn’t hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles M. Schulz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chocolate City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our research Bariloche was a strong contender to be one of our favourite cities in Argentina. It looked really picturesque, nicknamed the Lake District of South America with Swiss influences in its architecture and it has lots and lots of chocolate shops. We also caught the last day of the annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.welcomeargentina.com/bariloche/fiesta-popular-chocolate-bariloche.html&quot;&gt;‘Fiesta del Chocolate’&lt;/a&gt;; Bariloche had been decorated with colourful bunnies and eggs and children were queuing to meet the Easter Bunny in a grotto. It was like Easter met Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went in a number of shops hoping to pick up some cheap Easter eggs, but it seemed that Bariloche sell them all year round, so no such luck. Some of them cost around £20 and had an actual teddy bear inside. In the end we settled on treating ourselves with a tiny bar of Cadbury’s we’d found in a kiosk. However it definitely hadn’t come from Bournville as it had a bitter Hershey-like taste. It was very disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exploring Bariloche, we spent our last day doing what we do best, drinking and eating. We went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mamuschka.com/&quot;&gt;Mamuschka&lt;/a&gt;, a chocolate confiteria and finally caved and bought a couple of tiny chocolate bunnies to celebrate Easter. We also had the thickest and chocolatiest hot chocolates we’d ever drank, they were like melted chocolate in a mug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cerro Otto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://marcopoloinnbariloche.com/index.php/hostel-bariloche-english/&quot;&gt;Marcopolo Inn&lt;/a&gt;, which had possibly the most unhelpful staff we had yet come across on our trip. Asking for advice on what to do in the city and which buses go where, was like getting blood from a stone. On one of the receptionist’s bad advice on our first day we walked to Cerro Otto. He advised us to follow the road and suggesting it would take around an hour and 40 minutes. Not once did he mention a cable car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road up was dusty gravel and it was really steep. We didn’t see any tourists walking it and a number of intimidating dogs locked in gardens barked at us, making us jump as we walked past. Around a quarter of the way up, two dogs came out of the driveway of a house, barking, snarling and snapping at my ankles. I retreated quickly to the other side of the road and Dan said he had been ready to boot the one if it had bitten me. Thankfully as we walked off, the two dogs went back to their home and didn’t follow us. The dogs here were very different to those in El Calafate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight kilometres and two hours later we reached the top. The views were amazing of Nahuel Huapi National Park and Llao Llao, but by this time we were too pissed off to enjoy them. Dan had two huge blisters on the backs of both of his heels and my camera lens had stopped focusing so I couldn’t take any photos. We were also told by a tourist information centre at the top that the only way to access the restaurant was to buy a ticket for the cable car. The fee was $300ARS per person (£12). This cost included the cable car going both up and down and a return journey on the bus to the city. We weren’t able to buy a ticket one way and we were really annoyed that the hostel hadn’t just told us to pay the £12 and enjoy the ride up and down and just do some of the smaller trails at the top to enjoy the views. By this time, we’d run out of water, were desperate for a drink and there was no way Dan’s blisters were going to allow him to walk two hours back down. So we had no choice other than to pay the £12 to ride the cable car and get us off the tourist trap hill.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once back in the city, Dan changed into his flip flops and we desperately trawled around looking for a camera shop. As my Spanglish was not good enough to talk about a camera and the guy didn’t speak English we had a conversation over google translate and I reluctantly handed over my camera to him to have a go at fixing it. Two days later, he’d managed it. My hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Circuito Chico&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to avoid more national park fees so rather than get the boat to Nahuel Huapi National Park, we decided to instead explore the countryside on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barilocheturismo.gob.ar/en/short-circuit&quot;&gt;Circuito Chico&lt;/a&gt;. This is a road which loops around and there are lots of viewpoints of lakes and mountains and trails in the forest around it. Initially we were going to hire bikes and ride around it which takes 3-4 hours, but with big blisters from the walk the day before, we decided to go by public bus. We were told by the hostel it was easy to get public buses around Circuito Chico. We caught the 20 from town and it dropped us at Llao Llao where we had a look around San Eduardo Chapel. After this we started to walk towards the next viewpoint with the hope of jumping on a bus.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We kept walking along the road and it quickly became evident that there were no buses in this part of the circuit. In the end we walked 4.5 kilometres to the Tourist Information Centre in the hope that we could get some advice or pick up some bikes. However, as we turned the corner we saw it had closed down. We couldn’t believe it, the next stop, Bahia Lopez was 3km away and according to the information we had been given a different bus went from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Whilst walking the circuit we made sure we checked off the viewpoints so saw Lago Moreno and Lago Escondido. We saw some people biking but many of the trails said ‘no bikes’ so presumably all they could do was bike the road. It appeared the best way to get around was to hire a car and stop at each trail or viewpoint, then continue driving. As we reached Bahia Lopez it had started to rain and we hoped to find a bar at the beach. Wrong, it was closed and guess what, no buses in sight. Our options were either to keep walking, hitch hike or steal someones bikes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we weren’t yet desperate enough to hitchhike we kept walking, trying to enjoy the views along the way. It was quite misty which made the mountains and lakes look really eery. We stopped at Montanes Cemetery, a kilometre from the beach. It was really odd, up in the forest on a hill. We checked google maps to see how much further it was until there was possibly some civilisation and we found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cervezapatagonia.com.ar/&quot;&gt;Patagonia Brewery&lt;/a&gt; on the map. We had everything crossed that it was open, picked up the pace and continued to walk another 4km with the thought of a cold beer at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four hours of walking, 16km later, we made it to the brewery and had a cold overpriced wheat beer each. One of the members of staff told us that a bus goes past this part of the circuit every hour and the next one was coming at 17:00. We were really glad that we’d reached civilisation and had a way back to the city that wasn’t more walking or hitchhiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t help that we had visited in the autumn and not the summer, but it was clear that Bariloche was more for the Argentinian holiday-maker rather than the gringo back packer on a budget. Everyone had done the circuit by hiring a car and when we had explored the tours beforehand in the city, they were all in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steak and Breweries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of Bariloche’s redeeming qualities were the number of microbreweries in the city and the steak we had at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.altoelfuego.com.ar/&quot;&gt;Alto del Fuego&lt;/a&gt;. Dan managed to find a number of microbreweries including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BelekBariloche/&quot;&gt;Belek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bachmann.com.ar/&quot;&gt;Bachmann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cervezamanush.com.ar/&quot;&gt;Manush&lt;/a&gt;, each serving 5-10 different types of beer, ales and stouts and they were all willing to let us try samples before committing to a pint. They all had happy hour from 17:00-20:00 which was another bonus. An elderly gentleman from North Carolina struck up a conversation with us in Belek, he said he couldn’t resist talking to us when he heard we were English. He told us he had been in Argentina for around 5 weeks fishing in remote villages across the country and that he doesn’t speak Spanish. He was really well travelled and an interesting gentleman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alto del Fuego was a parilla or steakhouse. We went on our last night as Bariloche was our penultimate stop in Argentina and we were running out of opportunities to eat Argentinian steak. This was hands down the BEST steak we had ever eaten. We had beef de chorizo to share with chimchurri sauce and fries, washed down with a bottle of Malbec. The meat was so juicy it just melted in our mouths. The best part, the meal for two and wine only cost us £21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Bariloche&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning Bariloche didn’t live up to our high expectations. It was packed with Argentinian tourists enjoying their Easter weekend and didn’t seem to be made for the gringo backpacker. From the bad hostel advice we ended up walking 24km, got blisters and was almost bitten by dogs. However, with the help of its chocolate, steak and beer, it did manage to redeem itself.

&lt;p&gt;El Calafate is a small city in Argentina which seemed to be made for tourists. The main street ‘San Martin’, which is the name of all the main street’s in Argentina, was full of bars, restuarants, tour agencies and souvenir shops. Many of the shops looked like they belonged in a ski resort, made from glossy wood and filled with woolly jumpers. Again, there wasn’t much to do in the city unless we were prepared to pay £50-100 for day trips on boats and to the surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We tried to visit Laguna Nimez Reserve, a park full of local birds including Chilean Flamingos that was relatively cheap. It was walkable from the city, but when we got there it was both flooded and closed. We walked around the fence and we reached the edge of Lago Argentino, the biggest freshwater lake in Argentina. Many of the locals were fishing along the edge of the water but the wind was so cold we decided not to hang around. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.welcomeargentina.com/elcalafate/calafate-interpretation-center.html&quot;&gt;El Calafate Historical Interpretation Centre&lt;/a&gt; was on the way back, but at £6 to walk through a shed and see some dinosaur bones, we decided to save our pesos for happy hour later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dogs in El Calafate were different to any of the dogs we’d seen so far in South America. They roamed the streets, some with collars on and we struggled to work out if they were people’s pets or strays. After a bit of research we found out that they were strays but the local people look after them, feeding them, leaving water bowls on the streets and paying their vet bills. The dogs seemed to have territories, they were really playful and just wanted to be fussed. A cute Labrador had adopted our hostel, he just wanted to play fetch constantly with the sticks and pine cones he’d find in the streets. He saw us at the Historical Centre and walked us back to the hostel, he kept turning round to make sure we were following him, so we had no need for google maps!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food &amp;#x26; Wine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ate our first Empanadas in El Calafate, a stuffed pastry filled with meat. They were delicious and we were gutted we’d been missing out for so long. Being back in Argentina also meant better wine and Dan managed to find &lt;a href=&quot;http://cervezazorra.com/&quot;&gt;La Zorra Taproom&lt;/a&gt;, where he was content sampling the honey beers and stout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parque Nacional Los Glaciares&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Perito Moreno Glacier was the main reason that El Calafate was on our itinerary and why we had picked staying here over El Chalten, which was a little further north. The glacier is located in the Parque Nacional Los Glaciares which was around an hours drive away from the city. There was no public transport that went there so we had to suffer the $600ARS (£21) bus there and back. The bus dropped us around 10:30 and collected at 16:00, so we took our time walking around the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park was quite small in comparison to others we’d visited, with three trails offering different views of the glacier. The trails were on metal walkways which meant that they were really easy and didn’t take long at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we could even see the glacier, we heard it. As chunks of ice break off and hit the water, they make a thunderous noise which ecchos through the park. We could also hear the ice cracking and creaking in the glacier. The glacier itself was impressive. It moves 2 metres a day and is one of the only glaciers in the world advancing not retreating. After a few hours of watching the ice break off the glacier, with numb fingers and noses, we admitted defeat and went to the cafe to warm up with a crap coffee and wait for the bus back to the city.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bed bugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blahostel.com/&quot;&gt;Bla Hostel&lt;/a&gt; in an 8 bed dorm, which was again full of snorers. We struggled to recall a night in a dormatory where we had had a decent nights sleep without someone waking us up in the early hours with their snoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem one with the hostel was that there were two communal toilets for 50 guests, cleaned once a day. Often there was no toilet roll, soap and they were blocked. Second problem, lack of windows. The dorm we stayed in had a window that didn’t open and the heating on full blast - not sure why as it was around 12°C outside. It made the room really stuffy and gave me a sore throat. Third problem, bed bugs. After we had checked out we heard two Aussie guys, who were staying in a different dormitory, having a go at the receptionist as one of them was covered in bites. His mattress had bed bugs and the hostel had left the infested matress in the hallway! Being ridiculously paranoid we grabbed our bags and left spending the time waiting for our flight in a cafe rather than in the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were so paranoid that when we got to our next destination we checked through our bags and the seams of our clothes for hours with our torches to make sure we weren’t infested with bed bugs too. Luckily, we had a narrow escape, for now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on El Calafate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perito Moreno Glacier was absolutely stunning and made our time in the small city of El Calafate worthwhile. However, our stay was tinged with the paranoia of catching bed bugs which meant we were happy to be moving on.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Puerto Natales, Chile]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Travelling - it leaves you speechless and then turns you into a storyteller” Ibn Battuta.

&lt;p&gt;“Travelling - it leaves you speechless and then turns you into a storyteller”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Battuta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A change of scenery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next destination was our first stop in Chile, Puerto Natales. Initially we thought we would have to stay a night in Punta Arenas, but we were able to get two buses to complete our journey in one day. The bus left Ushuaia at 08:00 and dropped us in Punta Arenas at 18:30. Our second bus left at 21:00 and we finally got to our hostel in Puerto Natales at 00:30. One very long day! We crossed the border at San Sebastian, they were really strict about what we could take over the border so we had to eat our meat and cheese sandwiches, nuts and banana’s before crossing. Our driver reassured us that our stash of Yorkshire teabags which we had been rationing since we left the UK would be OK. However, the sniffer dog at the border was more interested in his tennis ball than making sure we weren’t smuggling anything in our bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way to Chile the landscapes changed dramatically; they seemed more desert like, like something out of a western film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ushuaia is on a large island, Tierra Del Fuego, so to get back to the mainland of South America we had a ferry crossing across the Strait of Magellan. We got off the coach on top deck, for some fresh air and we were glad we did as we saw two Commerson Dolphin’s jumping out of the water, they looked like mini Orca’s! Sadly, they didn’t hang around long enough for a photograph. Our stop in Punta Arenas gave us enough time to get some Chilean Pesos out of an ATM, a £5 charge this time, and to get some dinner before finishing off our journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The City of Puerto Natales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puerto Natales is a small city which most people use as a hub to get to and from their treks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://torresdelpaine.com/en/&quot;&gt;Torres Del Paine National Park&lt;/a&gt;. It was much more like the South America I remembered from my trip six years ago; less westernised – no McDonalds, Starbucks or branded shops and absolutely appalling slow internet! One of the first things we noticed about Chile, was how much friendlier people here were than in neighbouring Argentina; people smiled and said ‘hola’ as they walked past. It was also full of stray dogs but they seemed friendlier than those in Ushuaia and less diseased. We weren’t sure if they were people’s pets or actual strays. One of them even followed us back to the hostel from the supermarket probably in the hope that we’d share some of our cooked chicken.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hostalarkya.com/es-es&quot;&gt;Hostel Arkya&lt;/a&gt;, which was more of a guesthouse than a hostel. We weren’t allowed to use the oven in the kitchen, which meant we had to eat out every night, but on the plus side, this was the first place we’d stayed where we were allowed to bring alcohol into the hostel rather than buying it from them. This meant even cheaper bottles of wine, so we drank plenty. One evening we ate in a Mexican Restaurant, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cervezabaguales.cl/&quot;&gt;Cerveza Baguales&lt;/a&gt; which was also a brewery. Dan managed to demolish half a kilo of chips and three taco’s. They were pretty close to British ‘chippy-chips’ except a little thinner and no vinegar. We also ate at a nicer restaurant on our last evening, El Bote, Dan had Patagonian lamb and I had stewed Guanaco, not bad!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had three days in Puerto Natales, so aside from a day tour to the National Park, we used our time to relax and wander around the city. Tour companies offered lots of activities but at £60-£100 a day, they were well out of our budget. We stuck to the free things to do in Puerto Natales; there were some sculptures by the water’s edge and great views of the mountains on the other side of the water. On a rainy afternoon we paid a visit to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.welcomechile.com/puertonatales/municipal-historical-museum.html&quot;&gt;Municipal Historical Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which was really small but had a lot of information about the indigenous people in Chilean Patagonia. They only disappeared in the early 1900’s due to Europeans settling in the area bringing foreign disease with them. We were hoping that the museum would shed some light on the weird statues we had seen around the town, which were patterned and displayed male genitalia. It didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Torres Del Paine National Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torres Del Paine National Park was massive in comparison to Tierra Del Fuego, at least the bits where we could trek. There are a couple of circuits for trekking in Torres Del Paine, the O circuit and the W circuit. The O circuit takes 8 days and incorporates the W circuit within it, so W was shorter, 4-6 days depending on the weather. We didn’t feel fit enough or really have the time to do either of these treks so due to the park’s size, we opted for a full day tour. We went with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comapa.com/inicio&quot;&gt;Tourismo Comapa&lt;/a&gt;, which we picked randomly off the high street after realising all the companies charged the same amount. The tour cost $27,000 Chilean Pesos, which was around £32 and then we had to pay entrance fees which was the same again on top of this. Another very expensive day trip in Patagonia, but totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coach collected us at 07:30 in the morning and our first stop was the Miladon Caves. The Miladon is a prehistoric animal which looks like a giant sloth and its symbol is all over Puerto Natales. The cave has this name as its bones, fur and skin was found there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then headed to a viewpoint of Toro Lake; the bluest lake we’ve ever seen. After this we drove to the Grey Glacier. The roads were narrow and windy, and we read on the leaflet that road accidents are common in the park. Shortly after that we saw a car that had rolled over and off the road as there were scratches all over the top. None of the tourists really seemed that shook up and no one had been hurt. Our guide radioed for help as there is no phone signal in the park and we carried on to the Grey Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to cross a suspension bridge over a river to get to the view of the glacier on the black beach; this only allowed six people to cross at a time. We had a walk along the beach and ate our sandwiches looking out at the Grey Lake and Grey Glacier. Another great view for a picnic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour then took us closer to ‘the horns’, the mountain ranges of Paine Grande Hill, Cuernos del Paine and Almirante Nueito Mount and we had a lot of photo opportunities on the way. We also saw a waterfall, but after Iguazu Falls it was a little underwhelming, even with a double rainbow. There was also a thunderous noise and saw some white ‘smoke’ on the mountain, which the guide told us was an avalanche. Dan ordered a beer at the lunch time restuarant stop, the barman told us that if we walked to the other side of the hotel and went up the hill there was good views of the lake and mountain. Only a handful of people from the tour were up there so it was peaceful looking out onto the lake. These were by far the best views of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife in Torres Del Paine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came out of the mountainous part of the park and the landscape changed from mountains back to a dry desert like wilderness. We saw a herd of Guanaco’s crossing and the guide told us if we were quiet and slow we could get off the bus to see them. They looked a bit like Llama’s and now I knew what was on all of the menu’s in town.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver also  slowed down so we could watch some Emu’s as we drove past and when we got off at the last stop for a view of a lake, we saw a load of Andean Condors and some more Cararaca’s – the guide said that there must have been a dead animal where they were all congregating. We also saw Chilean Flamingo’s chilling in some of the lakes but from a bit of a distance. The second half of the day felt like we were on a Chilean safari, overall, not bad for spotting wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Puerto Natales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really loved Torres Del Paine National Park, although we felt we cheated a little by doing a day tour and not one of the hardcore circuit treks. We had perfect weather so the park looked very picturesque. Puerto Natales was a quaint little city, which gave us some time to relax and catch up on some rest before heading back to Argentina for more beautiful views of Patagonia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ushuaia, Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[“No one will protect what they don’t care about; and no one will care about what they have never experienced.” David Attenborough.

&lt;p&gt;“No one will protect what they don’t care about; and no one will care about what they have never experienced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Attenborough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Flight Nightmare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to Dan’s love of penguins, going as far south as possible in Argentina was an absolute must. Before we left we booked a tour in Ushuaia where we could walk among wild Gentoo’s, Magellanic Penguin’s and sometimes King Penguins on an island off the coast of the Beagle Channel. Getting to Ushuaia was expensive; a coach from Buenos Aires would take days so our only realistic option was to fly so we booked a flight with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dwtltd.com/&quot;&gt;Dream World Travel&lt;/a&gt; for £126 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to the Aerolíneas Argentina check in desk at the airport, the guy told us there had been a problem with our payment and sent us to go to the ticket desk. At the ticket desk, they told us to hold on five minutes. He disappeared for around thirty minutes, leaving us to become very anxious as time was ticking and there wasn’t long left before the gate closed and we’d miss the flight. After what felt like a lifetime, the manager told us that the agency ‘Travel Junction’ (who turned out to be a vendor for Dream World Travel) hadn’t made the payment to the airline. He told us we could either ring them again ourselves and speak to them or buy new tickets; he reminded us we didn’t have long as the plane would be leaving soon. We had no SIM cards in our phones, the next flight to Ushuaia was on Monday, we had accommodation and trips booked and paid for and we had 45 minutes to pay, check in and board the flight. £375 each for a new ticket later, we ran through the airport to board the plane! Of course the flight was delayed as we were on Argentina time, so whilst we waited we wrote a strongly worded email to Dream World Travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The City of Ushuaia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ushuaia is a small city of 75,000 people and apart from having a Hard Rock Café, it doesn’t feel like a city. It has one main street, San Martin which is full of shops, bars, restaurants and tourist information centres. There hadn’t been many stray dogs in Buenos Aires but there were loads in Ushuaia. A lot of them were just laid on the streets, they looked full of disease so despite having our rabies injections we resisted the temptation to stroke them. On our last night in Ushuaia, we declined an invite to go to a salsa bar and we went to the famous irish bar Dublin Pub instead. It was packed and seemed that everyone in Ushuaia came here at night. We weren’t sure why as it was packed, expensive and served green beer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ushuaia reminded us of places like Reykjavik in Iceland and Tromso in Norway, which in the past we have quickly fallen in love with. We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://antarcticahostel.com/&quot;&gt;Antarctica Hostel&lt;/a&gt; which again had a hostel cat! Dan said this one was his favourite as he was noisy and one night let himself into a dorm and fell asleep on someone’s bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met a lot of people staying here, including a Danish guy and a woman from Florida, who had come back from Antarctica and we were both very envious of their experiences. They told us about their time kayaking with whales and seeing the penguins in Antarctica. However, they also told us that the boat, on its way there and back, had rocked for 4 days, to the point where almost everyone was sick and people were huddled in the corner with life jackets on, sure they were going to die. It also cost them around $8000. Going to Antarctica was definitely well out of our budget!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Glacier Martial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The receptionist at the hostel had recommended several things to do in Ushuaia, one of them was a hike to Glacier Martial. He told us that most people get a taxi up for around $200ARS (£7) and then walk back down. He said it was 1.5 hours each way. As it was free to see the glacier, on the first day we got a taxi up there. It then turned out that from that point it was a 1.5 hour hike up to see the glacier, all uphill. We set off with our tree branch walking sticks that were at the entrance and made our way slowly to the glacier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some stunning views of Ushuaia and the Beagle Channel on the way and the surroundings made us feel like we were in Lord of the Rings. Annoyingly the view of the glacier had been better further away than at the end of the hike but at least we had done it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tierra Del Fuego National Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few different ways to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/en/tierra-del-fuego-national-park/&quot;&gt;Tierra Del Fuego National Park&lt;/a&gt; and one of them that we’d looked into was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trendelfindelmundo.com.ar/en/tarifas.html&quot;&gt;The End of the World Train&lt;/a&gt;. This used to transport prisoner’s from Ushuaia’s prison to work in the park. However, getting the train would only allow us to see a small part of the park and it was $850ARS (£30) on top of getting there and the park entrance fees. We went with the hostel’s recommendation and booked a bus there and back for $500ARS (£17) and then planned to walk the trails on our own. Armed with a photocopied map we followed the yellow posts around the park. The first trail we did was the Costera Trail (8km long) through the forest next to Lapataia Bay, it took us three hours. Unlike Ilha Grande, there wasn’t much wildlife to look out for, although we did see a Chimango Caracara up pretty close. What struck us was how quiet and peaceful the national park was, there was no sounds of people, traffic, insects or even water. Just pure silence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second trail we did was to Roca Lake and was only a 3 kilometre round trip. It was a great view so we braved the cold and stopped for a picnic. After this we did lots of little trails making our way to Lapataia Bay to the bus stop. The buses back came at 15:00, 17:00 and 19:00 and after being dropped off around 09:00 and our legs feeling like they were going to fall off by 13:00, we were keen to get the first bus back to the city. After walking Paseo De La Isla and past Laguna Verde we made it to the end of the trail and to the bus stop just in time for the 15:00 bus. We were also rewarded with the sign marking the end of the Pan-American highway, spanning from Alaska to Ushuaia. Literally the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expected the national park to be busy with lots of tourists on the trails, however it seemed that more people did the day tours on the coaches. This dropped them at the main viewpoints of the park so these places were a little bit busier, but on the trails there was no one around. How we didn’t get lost with our inaccurate paper map, lack of any kind of directions or signs and no proper hiking gear we’ll never know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Penguin Rookery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was definitely the highlight of our trip so far. Our tour, booked through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.piratour.net/en/&quot;&gt;Piratour&lt;/a&gt; took us to an island called Isla Martillo, where a colony of Magellanic Penguin’s live during the summer months to have their chicks in their burrows. They’d had their chicks in December so they were now adults. We’d also come at a time where they were moulting and were skinny from being on land for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to walk between their burrows and were told we could get up to two metres close to them but no closer. The guide told us that any closer would stress them out as their eyes would not be able to focus on us. He told us that they are not afraid of humans as long as they can see us. The penguin’s were mostly in two’s, pruning each other and some were in their burrows. They were also a lot less smelly than we’d anticipated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time with these penguins, the guides took us round to the beach, where there was a colony of Gentoo Penguins. On the way we saw a vulture devouring a dead penguin by the sea. The guides told us that the Gentoo’s stay on the island all year long and we saw 4-5 come out of the sea onto the beach after catching some fish. One of them waddled all the way up the beach to join the rest of the colony.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent an hour on the island, as it’s all that’s allowed so that the penguins do not become stressed. Piratour seemed to be the only company that offered tours to Isla Martillo and they were really strict about what we were and weren’t allowed to do on the island, so it didn’t feel like a tourist trap and felt that they actually cared about the penguins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the penguins, we had a hot chocolate in a cute little teahouse and then were taken to Acatushun Museum for a guided tour. This was really random, a little hut in the middle of nowhere full of bones that scientists have found washed up in Tierra Del Fuego of whales, dolphins and birds. We were also shown the lab where volunteers live, work and clean the bones. It stunk of a mixture of decaying flesh and freshly made cookies. A really bizarre end to our tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Ushuaia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the opportunity to walk between the penguins in their natural habit was incredible, like a real life episode of Planet Earth. It will certainly be difficult to beat! Hiking for hours through Tierra Del Fuego was also an experience as it’s a beautiful part of the world to explore. Annoying, but definitely worth the extra £375 to get there.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Without the streets nor dusks of Buenos Aires a Tango cannot be written.” Jorge Luis Borges.

&lt;p&gt;“Without the streets nor dusks of Buenos Aires a Tango cannot be written.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jorge Luis Borges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transport &amp;#x26; Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to Buenos Aires we took a bus from Puerto Iguazu, which cost us £80 and took 19 hours in total; it left at 14:00 and arrived at 09:00 the following day. We paid for ‘executive’ seats which were more like first class seats on an airplane.  We were given three meals, mostly bread and crackers, there was a TV with films dubbed in Spanish and we were given a small bottle of red wine with our meal. Our first taste of Malbec in Argentina. During the night we drove for hours through thunderstorms, with the lightening lighting up the sky every few seconds, luckily we couldn’t hear the thunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://puertolimonhostel.com/en/&quot;&gt;Puerto Limon Hostel&lt;/a&gt; which is easily our favourite hostel of the trip so far. The staff were friendly and there was a hostel cat called Max who Dan took a liking to. After Alz left we stayed in a private room which had cable TV, so I was able to watch Disney films dubbed in Spanish and it had a bath, so Dan was happy. The wine in the hostel was also $75ARS, which is around £2.70 for a good bottle of Malbec, #winning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;San Telmo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buenos Aires is a massive city and the hostel was in the oldest barrio San Telmo, which was very picturesque. It had cobbled streets and bars with tables set out in the plaza’s and on the streets. On Sunday there was a huge market which spanned down more blocks than we could walk down, selling lots of local crafts. Dan managed to find a cheap leather belt for his now too big Levi’s and we both bought new football shirts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could hardly go to Argentina and not go out for steak and wine, so we did, twice. We ate in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parrillalabrigada.com.ar/&quot;&gt;La Brigada&lt;/a&gt;, a restaurant recommended by the hostel for the best steak in the area. There were so many cuts of beef we managed to try t-bone, lomo (sirloin), tail of lomo and beef of chorizo; all mouth wateringly delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the immigrants settling in Buenos Aires from 1857-1940, there is an obvious Italian influence throughout the city. This has also shaped the way Argentinians speak Spanish, as beer is birra not cerveza. So, we thought we ought to eat at one of the many pizza restaurants too. We’d been warned that people think that the Argentine pizza is too cheesy, I didn’t think this was possible, but it really was! Dan had also researched a place called &lt;a href=&quot;http://thechickenbros.com/&quot;&gt;Chicken Bros&lt;/a&gt; which sold all you can eat chicken wings on a Tuesday, so it was inevitable that we were going to end up eating there too. We ate around 70 chicken wings in total, pure gluttony!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;City Centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As day three of Lollapalooza was cancelled we decided not to waste our time in Buenos Aires and we did the first of three &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buenosairesfreewalks.com/&quot;&gt;free walking tours&lt;/a&gt;, excessive we know. Our guide Fernando told us about how Argentina became a country and stories of the first people to settle there. He talked to us about Eva Peron, the first lady of Argentina from 1946-1952 who the nation loved and who Madonna played in the film Evita. He also showed us the Italian and Parisian architectual influences in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Recoleta Cemetery was one of the more peaceful places in the city. It was nice to get away for a short while from all the people shouting “cambio, cambio, cambio” at us on the streets of Buenos Aires, asking for us to exchange our money for their probably fake Argentine Pesos at their dodgy rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;La Boca&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to see a Tango show whilst we were in Buenos Aires but they were pretty pricey and the cheaper ones offered a lesson thrown in which Dan point blank refused to participate in. We’d heard that there were Tango performers in the barrio La Boca on Caminito so we headed to this area on the local bus to do some exploring. The boys were happy with this too as it meant a museum and stadium tour of La Bombonera, Boca Juniors football ground. We did a walking tour of the area as we’d been warned about theft at gunpoint in La Boca and to be aware of our belongings. Maru, our guide, told us about the area’s history and how the immigrants that came to populate Argentina ended up there. She also told us about the birth of Tango and a guy in La Boca let us look inside his house where he had lived for 40 years. He told us that at one point he lived with 11 other families all sharing one bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very vibrant and colourful part of the city which made for some great photographs. Maru explained that the origin of this came from people using scraps of material from the port to build their houses, included scraps of paint, meaning that they ended up being bright and multicoloured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a look around &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stadiumguide.com/bombonera/&quot;&gt;La Bombonera&lt;/a&gt;, which didn’t take long as the ground was tiny! We’d learnt on the tour that the people in the houses around the stadium had gone back on their agreement to sell their properties, so they could only build half of the stadium which is why it is so small. After the tour we stopped for a beer and watched the Tango dancers for a tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Palermo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to Palermo on our last day for a graffiti walking tour. We’d heard that as a city Buenos Aires was tolerant of street art and often commissioned artists to paint their houses, a lot of which occurred in Palermo. As soon as we walked into Palermo we realised we’d found the ‘hipster’ neighbourhood, full of bars selling craft beers and vintage shops. We spent the afternoon photographing the art in this area of the city and drank a few South American honey beers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Buenos Aires&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buenos Aires is a huge city with different districts; each one with its own style and personality. Our personal favourite was Palermo, with its quirky bars, vintage shops and graffiti on every block. We also tasted the best steak we’d ever had in San Telmo accompanied with a delicious bottle of Malbec which was for once within our budget.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lollapalooza, Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[“You lot are the best crowd I’ve ever performed in front of.” Liam Gallagher, Lollapalooza 2018, Argentina.

&lt;p&gt;“You lot are the best crowd I’ve ever performed in front of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liam Gallagher, Lollapalooza 2018, Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lollapalooza Argentina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were lucky enough to get tickets to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lollapaloozaar.com/&quot;&gt;Lollapalooza&lt;/a&gt; before we left the UK. It was after that we did some more research and found out that due to the laws in Argentina, alcohol cannot be sold at events that children can attend, which meant a sober music festival. Whilst breaking the news gently to Alz, we asked him what the worst thing was that could happen at Lolla, his first answer was that it was vegan, then he realised that it was the unthinkable and there was no alcohol. We had some thoughts about burying some or buying scarves with bags hidden in them to sneak some in, but the festival seemed strict. We decided to just accept it, after all, it could have been worse and been vegan!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our thoughts were right, Lollapalooza turned out to be very strict; on the first day they searched our bags twice and confiscated my biro, paracetamol, antihistamine and bite cream. The security woman contemplated confiscating my inhaler too but went with her better judgement and let me keep it. Security even searched through Dan’s snotty tissue in case he was hiding anything in there. Standards must have slipped after we got in and as the day went on because by 18:00 a lot of people in the festival were getting high on their smuggled in cannabis. But all was OK because at least I couldn’t dish out my paracetamol and antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t help comparing Lollapalooza to Glastonbury, which will always remain our absolute favourite music festival. In comparison, Lollapalooza was small with four stages for music, it also had a cashless system where wristbands had to be topped up and this was the only way to buy anything there. It had overpriced burger vans and ridiculously priced water which we had no choice other than to buy as the festival did not allow us to bring in our own food and drink. We did manage to find probably the best food at the festival and after a 45-minute queue had Rocking Chips with ketchup, bacon and spring onion. We were also pleasantly surprised that Lolla did turn out to sell alcohol! Alz was feeling better at this point and he managed to sniff out the Corona Beer Garden, so after getting our ID checked three times we were allowed our two per-day allowance of Corona. Hoorah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lolla was held at San Isidro which was around 45 minutes out of the city; getting the two metros and a train there and back was an absolute nightmare. Imagine thousands of people trying to catch a train back to the city at the same time after the headliners, it was carnage. The first night took us three hours to get back to San Telmo after a very long queue outside the train station and being squeezed onto an overly packed train. The second night we left 10 minutes early, missing The Killer’s ‘Mr Brightside’, a blessing in disguise really and managed to get back at a decent time and with room to breathe on the train.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music wise, the line-up was awesome, in the first two days we saw Oh Wonder, Spoon,Royal Blood, Imagine Dragons, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metronomy, Liam Gallagher and The Killers. They all put on a great show and made attempts to speak to the crowd in Spanish. All aside from Liam Gallagher who is of course far too arrogant to even say ‘muchas gracias’. However, he did tell the crowd that we were the best he had ever performed in front of! Due to horrific thunderstorms, which may have been summoned by Imagine Dragons when they performed ‘Thunder’, the third day of the festival was cancelled by the government, and we missed out on Milky Chance, LCD Soundsystem, Pearl Jam, Galantis and Kygo. During the night after the second day the thunder was so loud it set off car alarms, and one of the guys in the hostel said that the lightening had burnt up half of one of the stages at Lolla. People had also posted pictures on Facebook of San Isidro flooded and looking even muddier than Glastonbury. Lolla announced that they cancelled the third day of the festival in the interest of people’s safety and promised to reimburse everyone a third of the cost of the festival. Money we happily spent on more steak and wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Lollapalooza Argentina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music at Lollapalooza was of course amazing, however the poor planning and organisation of the festival let it down a little. We also think we’ve been totally spoilt by Glastonbury which has everything perfected to a tee. No festival will ever match up to its greatness, we’ll be coming for you Glastonbury 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sao Paulo & Iguazu Falls, Brazil]]></title><description><![CDATA[“There is a hidden message in every waterfall.

&lt;p&gt;“There is a hidden message in every waterfall. It says, if you are flexible, falling will not hurt you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mehmet Murat Ildan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One night in São Paulo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used São Paulo to break up our journey as we made our way to Foz do Iguaçu from Paraty. We spent less than 24 hours there and ended up eating our dinner in a shopping mall. As soon as we stepped out of the Metro station and onto the huge boulevard, it became evident as to why São Paulo is known as the ‘financial capital’ of Brazil. There were huge glass skyscrapers on each side of the road, uniquely shaped buildings and three lanes of traffic on each side of the boulevards. However, there was still a sense of underlying poverty in the city. On our walk back from the mall we saw two young boys hitting an empty glass bottle of vodka against the curb until it smashed. They cheered and then jumped onto the doorway of a bus as it was driving off, until the driver opened the door and it shoved them off. They were wearing scruffy clothes and one of them couldn’t have been older than seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had an interesting encounter on the Metro when we arrived, as three young men approached us and asked if we liked Tango. They proceeded to play Tango music right in front of us on their guitars and bandoneón for a couple of stops. What surprised us was that most people on the carriage applauded when they had finished and tipped them. If we had been in England, most people would have looked at their phones and pretended they hadn’t heard anything. We did as the locals did and gave them some of our Brazilian real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehostelpaulista.com.br/pt-br&quot;&gt;Hostel Paulista&lt;/a&gt; goes on our list of one of the grimmest places we’ve stayed. The mattresses were covered in blue plastic, the pillows in a plastic bag and Alz wasn’t provided with a blanket. The bathrooms were another matter altogether, the door had come off the women’s toilet, there were no locks on the showers and there was no toilet paper anywhere in sight after around 10PM. Safe to say after one night, we were glad to leave and carry on with our journey to Foz do Iguaçu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foz do Iguaçu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got off the plane in Foz do Iguaçu, the warm air hit us as we were back in temperatures of around 34C, even the breeze was warm. We opted for a local bus to get us to the hostel as the town seemed small. Getting on the bus with two backpack’s on, one on our back and the other on our front was a nightmare, as the bus had a pointless turnstile in the middle of it, which we had to go through once we’d paid. The woman accepting money for tickets got so annoyed with me trying to get through, she took my backpack from me and threw it over the turnstiles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had booked to stay at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tetrishostel.com.br/&quot;&gt;Tetris Hostel&lt;/a&gt;, made of shipping containers stacked on top of each other. We were shown to our 12 bed dormitory which was sweltering hot. We immediately thought that staying in a metal containers in such high temperatures was a mistake. However, the hostel offered free Caipriniha’s from 8:00-8:30PM which made it much more bareable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iguazu Falls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on our bucket list and one of the seven natural wonders of the world, we had always expected &lt;a href=&quot;https://iguazufalls.com/national-park/&quot;&gt;Iguazu Falls&lt;/a&gt; to be spectacular. What we didn’t expect was how long the waterfalls went on for and how big the National Park was, particularly on the Argentinian side. It was so huge we had to ride trains to get around. There are between 150-300 waterfalls in the park depending on the season, leading up to the big one Garganta del Diablo or ‘Devils Throat’.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Brazilian side, the platform out to Garganta del Diablo allowed us to walk to the middle of the river and look through either side of the falls. It was really loud and so powerful, that even from such a distance we were sprayed with the mist caused by the force of the water as hit the rocks. On the Argentinian side, we walked a platform across the top and watched the water as it pummelled down the rocks. The mist was so thick you couldn’t see the rest of the falls or the platform out on the Brazilian side. However, because of the sunshine and the mist, there were some vibrant rainbows that helped to make the perfect photo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also walked the upper and lower trails on the Argentinian side of the falls, which other than seeing the top of Garganta del Diablo, was probably our favourite part of the park because of all of the wildlife we saw. The lower trail also took us very close to a waterfall which was so violent it soaked us with it’s spray and mist, and the water was so loud we had to shout at one another to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were butterflies everywhere in the park, landing on our arms, bags and on people’s heads. Some people held out bits of fruit to attract them and the butterflies would sit on their hands for ages enjoying the sweet fruits. There were also Coati, racoon-like scavengers and there were warnings everywhere about them attacking people for food and that they may have rabies. We saw one woman stupidly sat on a bench eating some biscuits and when a Coati tried to jump up her, she kicked it away. They were however, deceivingly cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there were more walks through the park on the Argentinian side, we saw a lot more wildlife there. There were lots and lots of spiders, some which had made their webs over our heads on the trails, we quickly ran under those. We also spotted a really colourful Toucan up in the tree’s; I managed to snap a photograph before it was scared off by guided tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One even came into the crowd of people on it’s two legs, and because everyone was so busy taking pictures of the monkey’s in the trees, no one even noticed. Dan got a pretty good photo of it waving to everyone looking very cheeky.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if the day hadn’t been exciting enough, on one of our train journeys a jeep went past and in the front was a short haired blonde woman, looking very cool eating her ice cream - she looked remarkably like Katy Perry. As it turned out, she was Katy Perry. We heard one of the staff members later telling people she had come today and her presence at Iguazu Falls had even made the local news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crossing the Border&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d heard some horror stories about our intial plan of local transport to cross the border, where buses hadn’t stopped for people to be stamped out of Brazil leading to hefty fines. We got chatting to a Canadian girl in the hostel and she easily convinced us to share a taxi with her and a couple from England to cross the border to the Argentinian side of the falls, which was hassle free and cheaper than the hostel’s day trip to the Argentinian side. The hostel arranged this for us, however when the taxi came, the driver refused to take us as 4 of us had luggage. As it was nonsensical to pay double for two taxi’s on our budgets we went our separate ways and headed for the local bus stop. In actual fact it was pretty straight forward crossing the border from Brazil to Argentina; one bus to the Brazilian border, one bus to the Argentinian border and then another to the bus terminal in Puerto Iguazú. After an hour and a half, we were finally in Argentina and had to rembember to switch from obrigada to gracias. De nada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First thoughts on Argentina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dumped our bags at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.porambahostel.com/&quot;&gt;Poramba Hostel&lt;/a&gt; and headed into town to get some cash out of the ATM so we could head to the falls. The ATM charged us $240ARS (£8.54) to withdraw cash which was a bit of a shock. Apparently standard in the whole of Argentina! The bus was also £5.35 to the falls instead of the 80p it had been the Brazilian side; it became evident very quickly that it would be harder to stick to our budget in Argentina! It had been so much easier in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict Iguazu Falls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we’d initially done our research, people had recommended to visit both sides of the falls and we would totally agree with this. The Brazilian side gives great views from the bottom, but the Argentinian side is huge with unexpected surprises such as Toucan’s, monkeys and if your lucky even a celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ilha Grande & Paraty, Brazil]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Is it normal to have sweaty ears?

&lt;p&gt;“Is it normal to have sweaty ears? I’ve never had a sweaty ear in my life… They’re not even doing anything and they’re hot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Pilkington on Brazilian weather, An Idiot Abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arriving on Ilha Grande&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four busy days in Rio de Janiero, we’d planned to spend some time relaxing on the beaches of Ilha Grande. We booked a door to door transfer with &lt;a href=&quot;http://easytransferbrazil.com/en/&quot;&gt;Easy Transfers&lt;/a&gt; from Rio to Ilha Grande, we were collected at 07:00 and taken straight to the island; it was around a 3 hour drive and 45 minutes on a slow boat. We sat on the top deck and enjoyed the sunshine and a few beers until we got there. As we approached the ‘Big Island’ we could see why people in Rio had raved about how beautiful it was. There was a small stretch of bars, restaurants and pousada’s, coves of beaches and a pier towered by green hills covering the rest of the island. Dan said that it looked like ‘that island’ from Moana; he meant Te Fiti. The island was supposed to be very secluded with no cars and no ATMS, however on one of our treks we saw a bus full of tourists on the jungle path driving to Dios Rios. Definitely no banks or ATM’s though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the town was so small it didn’t take us long to reach &lt;a href=&quot;http://biergartenhostel.blogspot.com.br/&quot;&gt;Biergarten Hostel&lt;/a&gt;, where we had booked in an 8 bed dormitory to stay. It had two hammocks just outside our room and an odd shaped bench in the kitchen which Alz kept stubbing his toes on.  There was also a buffet style kilo restaurant attached, where we paid for the weight of food on our plates. On our second night in the hostel, new people came into the dorm, including two of the guys who had been at Books Hostel in Rio. One of them was Norweigian and had spent a night in Rio chatting to Alz about politics and finance over Caipirinhas; we joked that Alz had pulled so found it hilarious when he, by coincidence, ended up in our dormitory in the hostel on Ilha Grande. The second guy was from Bristol and snored like a fog horn; he was so loud my Harry Potter audiobook couldn’t drown him out, but at least we got to catch up on some sleep snoozing on the beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common animal we saw on the island were dogs. Lots and lots of dogs. They were everywhere, pooing on the beach, begging for food at night and walking the jungle trails to other parts of the island. We even saw a dead one, decomposing and washed up on the beach by the tide. Dan was highly amused by one dog who had dug a hole in the sand, was sat in it and was wearing a green tie. Some of the dogs seemed to have owners but others were strays and it was upsetting to see them so skinny and begging for food. It also meant that there was poo on the paths and main beach in Vila do Abraão, so we ended up spending most of our time in the little cove beaches slightly out of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our first night on the island we spotted a couple of Black Tufted-ear Marmoset’s in the Vila do Abraão on the electric wires, I managed to take one photo before they ran off and disappeared. As we had read that there were howler monkey’s on the island, we decided to do a bit of a walk through the jungle on the second day to see if we could see any. This wasn’t supposed to be for long as we wanted to chill out on the beach; we were also wearing sandals and had about half a bottle of water between us. As we reached the beginning of the trail, there was  a warning about mosquitos carrying yellow fever. We’d had our vaccinations but Alz hadn’t. He decided to come with anyway as the vaccination hadn’t been compulsory to visit Brazil and armed himself with insect repellent. We ended up walking along a trail to Dois Rios, which was on the opposite side of the island and at one point we became determined to do the 3-4 hour trek all the way there. However, after reaching a viewpoint we turned back as we were out of water and according to the map we were only about one third of the way there; the sun was out and it was midday so carrying on seemed like a stupid idea. The view was stunning of the bay and it was well worth the hour walk there and back. Sadly, we didn’t see any monkeys, just big ants, butterflies, a few types of birds and a great big spider.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we felt like we’d failed the trail the day before, the next day we decided to hike to Lopes Mendes rather than take the boat trip. This was a 3-hour trek and we were way more prepared, armed with snacks, lots of water, DEET and walking boots. We followed the signs from Vila do Abraão to Lopes Mendes and once we got off the beach and into the jungle we questioned what we’d let ourselves in for. The beginning of the trek was so steep; climbing up steps naturally made from tree roots and holes in the clay ground. We were all soaking in sweat within about 30 seconds and only saw one other person walking the trail who over took us, so it felt like we had the jungle to ourselves. The first part of the hike took us about 2 hours to the first beach, Enseada das Palmas. This was also pretty much deserted, and it was tempting to just stop there; however, we’d read that Lopes Mendes was one of the best beaches in Brazil. We had another 40-minute walk through the jungle to get to the next beach Praia do Pouso and from there we booked our speedboat water taxi back to Vila do Abraão for later in the afternoon. To reach Lopes Mendes we had another 20-minute walk through the jungle, this bit was busier with other visitors who had taken boats from Vila do Abraão to Praia do Pouso, as the boats did not go straight to Lopes Mendes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopes Mendes delivered as promised. The beach was huge and secluded, there were no restaurants or pousada’s there, just a couple of men with their carts selling drinks and snacks. The sand was white and so fine, as we walked along the beach it squeaked beneath our feet. The sea was crystal clear, warm and it was so shallow we could go out really far and the water was only up to our waists.  Even though we were knackered when we got to Lopes Mendes, we felt a sense of achievement. It was well worth the 3 hour trek across the island to get there but we were exceptionally grateful for the speedboat back to Vila do Abraão.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long day we ate at a restaurant called Steak n’ Beach and had a huge mixed grill for the three of us. It came on a sizziling hot plate and consisted of two pork chops, two steaks, two chicken breasts and four Brazilian sausages, accompanied with a bowl of rice, a mound of chips and some salsa. It cost us $145R which is around £32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paraty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days on Ilha Grande we left for Paraty on our Easy Transfer and it took around 4 hours to reach the town from the island. The weather was overcast and it rained for half of our time in Paraty. On our walking tour in Rio, the guide had said that we had come to Brazil at a time where the seasons were changing which meant that the weather was hot but with some rain in the afternoon. Because of the weather, there wasn’t a lot to do in Paraty. I also felt a little unwell and Alz developed a fever, headache, muscle ache and loss of appetite. He googled his symptoms and decided it was likely he had yellow fever. It turned out that in November 2017 an outbreak of yellow fever had started in the State of Rio de Janiero and State of Sao Paulo; worsening in January 2018. Specifically people had contracted the disease on Ilha Grande!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason the free walking tours had been cancelled in Paraty and we didn’t want to risk a boat trip or a bus ride to Trindade to spend the day on the beach as it kept raining on and off. Therefore, we milled around the old town which was very picturesque, with its colourful boats, buildings and cobbled streets. The people of Paraty also seemed to have a fondness for classic VW Beetles, which were colourful and matched the style of the town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was here that we finally saw more monkeys! We were having breakfast in our hostel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sambacanutahostel/&quot;&gt;Samba Canuta&lt;/a&gt; and the staff told us that there were monkeys in the tree’s, they tried to coax them down with banana’s but they were having none of it. They lingered around long enough for me to get some good pictures on my camera though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The hostel itself was very quiet and we were pretty much the only guests staying there, which made the communal areas very awkward as all the staff seemed to do all day was play guitar and sing the Portuguese version of the Eagle’s ‘Hotel California’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verdict on Ilha Grande &amp;#x26; Paraty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ilha Grande didn’t turn out to be such a relaxing destination after all as we did lots of hiking through the jungle across the island. We ended up with around 30 mosquito bites between us but totally worth it for the beautiful views and beaches. Following this, we enjoyed our chilled out time in Paraty; a beautiful colonial town with lots of character that wasn’t even the rain couldn’t spoil.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rio De Janeiro, Brazil]]></title><description><![CDATA[“I sorta think from a distance… Jesus, top of a hill, lookin’ like he’s about to bungee jump, you pass it, you go, ‘There he is.

&lt;p&gt;“I sorta think from a distance… Jesus, top of a hill, lookin’ like he’s about to bungee jump, you pass it, you go, ‘There he is. Great. What else are we doin’?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Pilkington, An Idiot Abroad (not bitter at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arriving in Rio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we left for Rio, we were told in many ways about how dangerous it is there. We did a bit of research the night before and read about the trouble following the Rio Olympics. The government arrested some people to make the favela’s safe and promised to make the them better. The Olympics came and went and the government didn’t follow through with any of their promises to improve things such as health and education, which resulted in the violence within the favelas escalating. It seemed from google maps that our hostel was also surrounded by favela’s and we then read that because of the trouble there, the military had taken over the city. Felipe running &lt;a href=&quot;http://bookshostel.com/&quot;&gt;Books Hostel&lt;/a&gt;, where we were staying had also warned us not to take money out at the airport due to credit cards being cloned. To make matters worse, when we arrived in Portugal for a stop over, the lady running the hostel told us about her daughter who had been to Carnival a few weeks ago. She had been staying in Leblon, an area close to the biggest favela in Rio, Rochina, she had heard gunshots in Leblon and saw lots of people running away from the area. She warned us to be careful. This made us question why we were starting our trip in Rio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a horrendous flight we arranged a transfer with the hostel as we arrived so late. The driver pulled up in a Fiat with absolutely blacked out windows and drove us through the streets of Rio, we managed to see Christ the Redeemer lit up on Corcovado mountain. No crimes were witnessed in our first hour of Rio, however at traffic lights we heard people chanting and I thought there was going to be a protest or some sort of gang violence around the corner, it turned out to be football fans chanting in a bar following a Flamengo goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we did in Rio was head to the beach. The guy at the hostel recommended Gloria Beach, which he said was walkable. We didn’t take any valuables with us whilst we were still sussing the city out. However, our visit was trouble free, the sand was white and we had a great view of Sugarloaf Mountain and of Christ, when he didn’t disappear behind the clouds. The people selling beer and drinks were very friendly and it seemed to be full of locals jogging or sunbathing. As it is so infamous, we then got an Uber to Copacabana beach, Dan and Alz warned me that I would prefer Gloria and they were right. Every thirty seconds someone was in our face trying to sell something, sunglasses, empanadas, bikinis, canga (sarongs), caipirinhas and weed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last day in Rio, we did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freewalkertours.com/&quot;&gt;free walking tour&lt;/a&gt; of the Copacabana and Ipanema area. Our guide told us about the World Cup and how everyone gathered in front of the big screens to watch the games on the beach. We went to the restaurant where “The Girl from Ipanema” was written and walked to Lagoa Rodrigues de Freitas, a big lake, to watch the sun go down. The guide gave us some Brazilian snacks to try including Biscoto Globo, a weird banana sweet and some Guarana, an energy drink that tastes like red bull. By this time, we felt much more comfortable and confident in Rio and walked around the most expensive part of town to find some food after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Christ The Redeemer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had seen Christ the Redeemer lit up at night and from Gloria beach, but what’s a trip to Rio without seeing the wonder of the world up close. Following some advice from a dutch girl on our free walking tour of Downtown and Lapa, we decided to do as she did and get an Uber up Corcovado Mountain to see him in all his glory. The driver spoke no english and on the way either stopped in front of a favela to ask for directions or tried to drive through it, we’re still not sure. Either way, luckily a guy wearing an official guide t-shirt turned him away or told him the right way to go. After getting to the top, we went to buy our ticket, only to be told that there was no visibility at all and the live camera on Christ was just pure white from the cloud. We waited for some time and the boys had more beers, but the cloud didn’t shift and in the end we had to give up and pay excessive amounts to get back down the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on ‘Christ watch’ for the rest of the time in Rio, trying to catch a glimpse of him in a clear sky,  meaning we might get the opportunity to go up again. However, during the last two days of our trip he was completely covered by cloud, except for around thirty seconds when we were watching the sunset on our last night, he peeped out just to rub our noses in the fact that we hadn’t been able to see him up close during our time in Rio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Art &amp;#x26; Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the full Rio experience we decided to do a couple of walking tours to learn about the history and culture of the city. On the tour of Downtown and Lapa we tried Coxinhas, breaded chicken balls with cheese inside (that tasted a bit like mac and cheese balls) and ended up at the bright tiled steps ‘Escadaria Selaron’, a gift from Jorge Selaron to the city which took him over 23 years to finish. They were really bright and vibrant and one of our favourite parts of the Rio, leading to the Santa Teresa neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a wander to Olympic Boulevard during a pretty loud thunderstorm, one strike of lightning was so close and so loud it made the lady crossing the road next to Alz grab his arm. At Olympic Boulevard we saw probably the best street art we’ve seen in any city we’ve been to so far. It was a huge mural by Eduardo Kobra completed for the Olympics; it was so colourful and vibrant and represented the five continents of the games. On the way we also visited the very ugly Cathedral which is inspired by a Mayan Pyramid, Dan repeatedly told us that “beauty comes from within”. It looked a bit like the old Birmingham Library before it was torn down.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a good view of the city, we decided instead of paying extortionate amounts for Sugarloaf and risking the cloud of Corcovado Mountain we walked up the very steep hill to Santa Teresa, the hipster ‘foodie’ area of Rio. On the way Alz got a bit cocky and jumped up a steep step, resulting in his shorts tearing along the crotch. We got a good panoramic view of the city from Parque Das Ruinas, except for Christ, who remained behind the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Rio seeming to be a city that never sleeps, where the fruit and vegetable stores are open until the early hours of the morning, we had heard that the city is very quiet on a Sunday, and what we heard wasn’t a lie. The only places open seemed to be McDonalds and Starbucks. As there wasn’t a lot to do, we went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://visit.rio/en/que_fazer/mam2/&quot;&gt;Modern Art Museum&lt;/a&gt;, Alz and Dan particularly enjoyed mocking Giacometti’s “Four Women on Base”. We then went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mhn.museus.gov.br/&quot;&gt;Museu Historico Nacional&lt;/a&gt; which was free on a Sunday; we pretty much had the museum to ourselves as it was so quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food &amp;#x26; Caipirinhas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hostel we stayed in sold £1 Caipirinhas, either lime or passionfruit and we definitely had our fill of these. They have possibly rocketed to one of our favourite cocktails. Something which took some time getting used to was that everyone shared 600ml bottles of beer, we got very strange looks when we tried to order one each so followed the Carioca trend and shared and drank from teeny tiny glasses. On Alz’s birthday we went to a local restaurant called Os Ximenes; we had two massive steaks, Brazilian sausage, scrambled egg in Farofa, a tasteless brazilian flour, rice and chips. It was delicious although covered in about three bulbs of diced garlic. Safe to say we stank the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Rio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from being hot, Rio really wasn’t what we had expected it to be, it was so much better. It was diverse, colourful, vibrant and full of life. We barely touched the surface in four days and as we didn’t get to see Christ the Redeemer up close, one day we’ll definitely go back.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
