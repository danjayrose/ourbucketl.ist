&lt;p&gt;“My plan is to dance until everything is solved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One hell of a bus journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were concerned about getting on another Colombian bus after our trip to Salento but we’d been told that the road to Medellin was much straighter, taking around 7 hours on the bus service &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flotaoccidental.com/en/&quot;&gt;Flota Occidental&lt;/a&gt; directly from Salento. Again it only cost $47000COP (£12) and at 11AM after a big brunch we boarded the little minivan and headed out of Salento. The first warning sign of things to come was that there were no seatbelts and poor air conditioning. A couple of hours into winding round the countryside we realised the roads were going to be exactly the same as the ride from Bogotá to Salento. The only difference was it was now daylight so we were able to see how absolutely mental the driver was, going full speed around corners, overtaking on corners, stalling on every hill start and generally being completely wreckless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the rain in Colombia there were a number of landslides on the road meaning there were road works causing lots of traffic. At one point we saw a car on the other side of the road slam straight into a cow that had wandered into the road. We stopped around four hours into our journey so our driver could catch the second half of the Colombia vs Egypt match and enjoy his beer with his late lunch! Nine hours after we set off, with only one toilet stop, we arrived in Medellin; absolutely knackered, starving and incredibly dehydrated as we hadn’t dared to drink anything. We brought some beers and water from the bus station (essential supplies) and headed to our Airbnb with a takeaway pizza in mind and a good nights sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Downtown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d been looking forward to exploring Colombia since the beginning of our trip but sadly in the back of our minds was the stigma attached to the country, that is that it’s dangerous. Particularly Medellin, the once murder capital of the world! We explored downtown with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realcitytours.com/barrio-transformation-tour/&quot;&gt;Real City&lt;/a&gt; free walking tour on our first day to see what the Medellin was actually like. We were eager to learn about the country’s 54 year conflict and what it had been like living in Medellin, but sadly the tour didn’t live up to our expectations. The guide barely mentioned Colombia’s recent history and it felt like she was ignoring the elephant in the room, which we found really irritating. Instead she showed us where we could shop for fake goods, pointed out the prostitutes that work near the church so that men can repent their sins straight after the deed and we saw some breakdancers who were really amazing dancing to J Balvin, ‘Mi Gente’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the guide didn’t go into masses of detail about the the political and economical conflict between the guerillas, paramilitary groups and cartels, she did emotionlessly point out a couple of places in the city that had been affected by violence. She walked past a balcony at the metro station where a grenade had been dropped killing lots of people and she also showed us Plaza de San Antonio, which contains two bird sculptures by Botero, one of which had been blown up in 1995 during a music concert killing 30 people and injuring 200. The guide talked a lot about the transformation of the city quite desperately and explained that Colombians are happy people because they forget what had happened to them in the past, and look to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of Medellin being dangerous, there were obviously places that we wouldn’t have wandered around during the night but it didn’t feel dangerous at all and was like any other South American city. The only difference was that people in the streets would say “Hola Gringo!” and wave; the guide told us not to take this offensively as people in Medellin are happy to see tourists and that’s why they stare and say hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pablo Escobar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we had left the UK, a Pablo Escobar tour in Medellin wasn’t even up for debate it was a must! However we changed our minds very quickly once we arrived in Colombia. One reason was cost, a Pablo Escobar tour would set us back between £40-150 to see where he used to live, his grave, where he imprisoned himself and the roof where he was killed. Some of the reviews also said that the guides really glorify him, ignoring the fact that he murdered hundreds of innocent people with his acts of terror; we were uncomfortable enough seeing people selling caps and tshirts with his face on them around Colombia. In Bogotá, the walking tour guide had rightly referred to Escobar as a terrorist and talked about Colombians being unhappy that he is glorified as a protagonist in the Netflix series ‘Narcos’. The guide told us that she had met some backpackers who had been to Medellin and told her that they had paid a lot of money for a city tour from John Jairo Velásquez (or Popeye) Escobars hitman. She said they’d been excited about it, until she’d asked them why they were so excited about being shown around by a serial killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we did the walking tour in Medellin, it became evident that some Paisas (people from Medellin) aren’t ready/willing to talk in detail about the violence in their country. We had planned to ask the guide how we could learn more about Escobar without doing anything insensitive but just the question seemed insensitive when she hadn’t even addressed Escobar by name; in the end we didn’t bother and decided to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://medellin.travel/MedellinTravelWeb/locations/101/house-of-memory-museum?lang=en&quot;&gt;Museo Casa de la Memoria&lt;/a&gt; which she recommended to learn more about the Colombian conflict and its victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Museo Casa de la Memoria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Museo Casa de la Memoria turned out to be very interactive and we were able to download an app to follow around the museum. Sadly most of the interactive stuff was in Spanish but there was free WiFi to help translate! It wasn’t a bad way to spend a few hours for free, looking at photos and newspaper articles about FARC, ELN and Narco Terrorism. The most hard hitting part were the big TV’s where victims told their stories about being displaced and terrorised during the conflict, these had subtitles in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the museum was good, it still didn’t seem to satisfy our thirst for information about the history of the country. Something was missing, to us it felt like Medellin doesn’t want to accept its past, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://colombiareports.com/medellin-needs-pablo-escobar-museum/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; really sums up how we felt about the lack of information for tourists to really understand what Colombians have been through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Atlético National vs Atlético Huila (written by Dan)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greeno and I jumped in an Uber to the Atanasio Girardot Stadium to watch Atlético National vs Atlético Huila in the second leg of the play off semi final. We had bought the tickets from a restaurant on the advice of the tour guide for $76000COP (£20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived we were immediately flagged down outside a bar so we stopped for a few beers and to soak up the atmosphere amongst the locals. In between being offered fake shirts, cigarettes and everything else we noticed a group of lads drinking beers and snacking on large bowls of fruit. On reflection this probably explains the lack of obese fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following our struggle trying to find the right entrance we eventually made it inside just before kick off. Having been advised previously to not sit in the south end we could see why. The fans were bouncing and singing all game, which I’m sure would have been an experience, but probably not if you wanted to watch the game. We were on the lookout for players we recognised but it wasn’t until Zuniga, formerly of Watford, who was subbed on that we had found one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the final score was 0-0, for a goalless draw it was pretty exciting and the quality of football was better than we expected. We lost count of the number of times the woodwork was hit and, but for the crossbar, we almost saw a 35 yard free kick fly into the top corner for Huila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first leg also finished 0-0 this meant that the game went to penalties which was probably the best Huila were hoping for, as the game panned out particularly after they had a man sent off. Nacional had the clear advantage as the penalties were taken right in front of the boisterous south stand fans and they subsequently won 4-2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Nacional they didn’t go on to win the competition as they were beaten by Deportes Tolima in the final on penalties. Even though Nacional finished top of the table, in the Colombian Primera division, the top 8 teams at the end of the season enter into a play off tournament to determine the winner. I would definitely say they will feel hard done by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El Poblado&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the night life area in Medellin, where all of the bars, lots of restaurants and most of the hostels are. However it was much pricier than anywhere else we had been in Colombia! We went there on two nights that we stayed in the city, the first for some beers and mojitos and the second we ended up in a reggaeton club called &lt;a href=&quot;https://vintrash.co/&quot;&gt;Vintrash&lt;/a&gt; after a massive jug of spiced rum sangria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Guatapé&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a day trip to Guatapé with a private driver arranged through the Airbnb we were staying at as it worked out cheaper than a tour. We stopped at El Peñón de Guatapé first, a massive rock with over 700 steps to climb for fantastic views of the lake. What we hadn’t anticipated was that it was Colombian bank holiday Sunday, it was sunny  and the place was absolutely rammed! However we had some mango biche and some tinnies at the top before queuing to come back down.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our driver Cristian then took us to the town Guatapé. It was really colourful, a little like Salento but each house was probably even more colourful with some gorgeous frescos on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ate in a restaurant on the plaza and Iz and I had Banjeras Paisa, a typical dish from the Antioque region of Colombia. It’s a tray full of food; chorizo, fried pork belly, mince, rice, beans, fried egg, fried plantain, avocado, arepas and a token bit of salad. Absolute workers dinner and very filling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Medellin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We liked Medellin, but felt that the city didn’t really know how to handle its growing tourism, not wishing to address Escobar who is sadly a huge part of their history. The city of Medellin is somewhere we would like to visit again to see how it changes and we’d definitely spend longer there. Some of the graffiti we drove past around the city was probably some of the best we’d seen in South America and had we been there another day we definitely would have done the graffiti tour in Communa 13. However, it was time to head to the sunshine and the islands on the Caribbean coast!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Salento, Colombia]]></title><description><![CDATA[“What matters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it.” Gabriel García Márquez Transport…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//salento/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//salento/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What matters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel García Márquez&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transport &amp;#x26; accomodation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took an overnight bus from Bogotá to Salento so we wouldn’t lose any precious daytime. We did plenty of research about the trip, nothing said it was dangerous and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bolivariano.com.co/&quot;&gt;Bolivariano&lt;/a&gt; came up top out of all of the different services. It cost us £12 each for the journey which was supposed to take around ten hours. Nothing on the internet and nobody warned us about how winding the roads were, or how crazy the driver would be. We snaked around the mountains for so long that people on the bus were throwing up in sick bags and no one could sleep as everyone was bracing themselves in their seat by their feet. It was easily the most horrific journey we’d done in three months in South America. Eventually the driver dropped us on the side of the road 8km out of Salento and told us to wait for a bus that comes every 15 minutes to finish our journey. The bus turned out to be a tiny collectivo that came every 30 minutes, we couldn’t fit on the first and ended up waiting a good 45 minutes before we could finally finish our journey to Salento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1580963-d11253739-Reviews-Hostal_Familiar_Jerico-Salento_Quindio_Department.html&quot;&gt;Hostel Familiar Jerico&lt;/a&gt; in a family room as we were now four and not two. The hostel was run by a Colombian family who didn’t really speak English but were really welcoming and made us possibly the best coffee we’ve ever had. It contained aguapanela (sugar cane water) and it was so good that after one sip Greeno was instantly converted into a coffee lover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Town&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salento is a small town in the Andes. Most of the houses are painted different colours, making it very photogenic. We walked to the edge of town and up some beautiful colourful steps for good views of the small Colombian town. Apart from eating, drinking or shopping there wasn’t much to do in Salento itself; it seemed very touristy and set up for the activities around it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made the most of a place called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/brunchdesalento/&quot;&gt;Brunch&lt;/a&gt; which we’d discovered after our horrendous journey to Salento. It was a backpacker cafe which did amazing massive breakfasts all day for just £4-5. We loved the food and portions so much, we ended up going to eat there every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tejo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d read about this game before we even got to Colombia and thought it would be fun to try. It turned out to be like an old school bowling alley. First we were told we had to have beer to play, four Club Colombia’s all round. We then had to choose a rock and the guy told us the aim was to hit the bits of gunpowder wrapped in paper around a metal ring. He showed us the best technique and told us how to keep score. Mainly we just wanted to hit the gunpowder to get it to explode. We all managed to hit the ring or gunpowder but Greeno was the only one who actually managed to make it go bang. After a while it got a little tedious and we gave up; but was a fun game to play for $3000COP (80p).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coffee Farm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deliberated over all the different coffee farms in the area and which one to visit; some offered in depth three hour tours, some were offered in English and others in Spanish. In the end we went with a 1.5 hour tour at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fincaelocasosalento.com/web2/en/&quot;&gt;Finca del Osaco&lt;/a&gt;. We walked the hour there downhill on the dirt track enjoying the lush green scenery and got a Willy Jeep back to town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two tours offered, a basic one for $15000COP (£4) and a premium tour for $65000COP (£17) the main difference being that we would get to try more types of coffee. We went with the cheaper option and our guide Andres showed us around the farm. It wasn’t a small or a family run coffee farm but it was interesting all the same. We got to pick and plant some beans and were shown how the beans are dried out and how coffee is made. At the end we got to try some medium roasted Colombian coffee which was very mild and weak compared to European coffee, but pretty good all the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Valle del Cócora&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valle del Cocora is a valley full of Quindío wax palm trees which were left there from the Pacific Ocean. There were two ways to see the trees, to hike for 5-6 hours or to just walk the 1km path there and back. Luckily, Greeno and Iz were up for the hike. We’d read and been told that the best way was to go anti-clockwise, so that there was just one short steep climb upwards and the rest was downhill, it also meant we saw the trees in the valley at the end and not at the beginning. We’d been warned it was muddy and we could hire wellies at the beginning of the hike, however we’d also been told its not all muddy and 6 hours is a long time to spend in wellies. In the end we all decided to risk trainers and walking boots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we’d been warned, we weren’t really prepared for how muddy at least the first part of the hike was, think Glastonbury mud! Poor Iz put her foot in the first muddy puddle, up to her ankles, trainers ruined. The first part of the hike took a while as we were trying to navigate walking on the least muddy parts whilst not cutting ourselves on the barbed wire. The second part of the hike was through tropical forest. We’d hoped to see some wildlife but other than a lone kingfisher and some people riding horses we didn’t manage to see anything else. Although in the forest we had to cross the river over a number of rickety suspension bridges - great fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part was the climb uphill, we skipped the Hummingbird Sanctuary as it was 1.5 hours out of our way and we wanted to spend more time at the trees, especially as the sun was shining! The climb uphill was steep and a little slippy on the hard mud, it was a great feeling getting to the top, so much so that Greeno shouted “f**k me!” and everyone up there laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top we sat eating our lunch from Brunch with hummingbirds fluttering around us. We also made friends with the dog at the top, who liked to eat scraps of bread and Pringles but wasn’t a fan of tomato or cucumber. A lot of people had walked clockwise, seeing the trees first with a downhill walk through the forest and a lot of mud to end their hikes. We found it quite amusing when they saw the state of our trainers and boots and then looked down to their own immaculately clean vans and converse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a break we got to walk the dirt track downhill towards the trees. We took loads of photos of the absolutely gigantic palm trees in the middle of the Andes and then sat in the sun trying to dry out our socks and feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to get a Willy Jeep back at 14:00 and we’d started our hike at 08:00, not bad going as we’d made the most of our $5000COP entrance fees to see the infamous Colombian Quindío was palm trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hot chocolate with cheese&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d heard about hot chocolate with cheese and decided we needed to try it as a ‘Colombian delicacy’. It’s a bowl of hot chocolate (with cinnamon) and a big chunk of cheese. The idea is to cut up the cheese put it in the chocolate, let it melt a little and then eat it. Sounds gross but the cheese was very creamy and mild, think mozzarella not cheddar. It actually wasn’t half bad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Salento&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all loved Salento, a sleepy colourful little town in the countryside. Greeno discovered his love for coffee (and hiking), we had amazing food, drank Mojitos, discovered Tejo and got to ride in Willy Jeeps. For anyone visiting Colombia in the future, Salento is a must!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bogotá, Colombia]]></title><description><![CDATA[“When grey streets are flooded with colour, the hearts of passers by are lifted by the brushstrokes, tones and creativity and they let their…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//bogota/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//bogota/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When grey streets are flooded with colour, the hearts of passers by are lifted by the brushstrokes, tones and creativity and they let their imaginations fly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivianne Pantojoa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graffiti Walking Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we decided to do in Bogotá was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://bogotagraffiti.com/&quot;&gt;graffiti walking tour&lt;/a&gt;. We thought it would help us to get our bearings around the city, it had come recommended by many and because there was street art everywhere! Our first day in Colombia was a Sunday and there were soldiers all over the city, lots of things were closed so it was hard to work out if the areas we were walking around were dodgy or just closed because it was Sunday. It turned out to be election day which meant two things - soldiers all over the city at the polling stations and dry law. No alcohol is sold or to be consumed by law on Election Day in Colombia. We were not happy tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling safer with our graffiti guide to tour the city we wandered around La Candeleria and Downtown looking at the street art. The guide told us that street art is illegal in Bogotá but it is now recognised as a cultural expression and has been decriminalised. The guide explained this was because of two things that happened. The first was that two police shot a 17 year old boy, Diego Felipe Becerra, dead when he ran from them scared after he has been caught graffitiing. The second was that shortly after this event Justin Beiber visited Bogotá and graffitied in the city, except he was accompanied by the police as escorts for protection. Shortly after his graffiti was covered up by artists in protest and the government changed the law to decriminalise graffiti in Bogotá.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dry Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bogotá we became four as Iz and Greeno had joined us on our travels. After the walking tour we were looking forward to a nice cold beer to celebrate only to find out that there wasn’t going to be any. There is a law in Colombia that alcohol cannot be sold or consumed on Election Day meaning they many bars and restaurants were closed. We managed to find a Mexican restaurant for some food and went back to the Airbnb early with little else to do. We walked back to find that the road had been blocked off with TV crews and there was some kind of protest on the next block. We watched from the 11th floor that our apartment was on, a massive crowd had gathered outside the registry office in Bogotá and we think that they were watching the election results. We later found out this was the most peaceful Election Day in Colombian history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monseratte&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogotá is a very cloud and rainy city, we saw blue sky on a handful of occasions during our visit. We decided to risk the cloud and headed up to Cerro Monseratte hoping to catch some good views of Bogotá city. We got the cable car up which was $20,000 Colombian pesos return (£5.20). Monseratte went up to 3100 meters above sea level and air was definitely thinner up there. It was cloudy and at first we couldn’t see anything but eventually the clouds broke and we were able to appreciate how big Bogotá actually is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;La Chicha &amp;#x26; Chicken Wings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing about chica for around six weeks we finally got round to trying it! It’s fermented corn beer and people used to ferment it by chewing the corn and spitting it in a big tub. It isn’t made like this anymore but regardless it wasn’t good. It was very thick and tasted a little like fizzy apple cider.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walking tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the graffiti tour had very much focused on the art around the city we decided to do a generic walking tour on our last afternoon, mainly to knacker ourselves out for our overnight bus to Armenia. We learnt a little about Colombian politics, why ELN and FARC guerilla groups formed in the country and about the peace agreements with the FARC group that have led to them handing in their weapons. The guide also explained a little about the cartels and the paramilitary and how they also fit within the politics in the country. She talked about an open investigation where the Supreme Court of Justice in Bogotá had burned and hostages had been killed inside. She talked about how it’s believed this was initiated by a guerrilla group M19 but still remains unsolved.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide also told us a little about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Botero&quot;&gt;Fernando Botero&lt;/a&gt;, a famous Colombian artist and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez&quot;&gt;Gabriel García Márquez&lt;/a&gt;, a Colombian Nobel prize winner for literature. We wandered around the La Candelaria area during and after the tour, very annoyed that we were not staying another evening to explore the hipster bars in the neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Bogotá&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people had told us that Bogotá isn’t a nice city and not to bother but actually the two days we had in the city wasn’t nearly long enough! La Candeleria was definitely our kind of neighbourhood with shops and bars and somewhere we wished we could have spent more time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lima, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“For more than half the year Lima has a peculiar climate.

&lt;p&gt;“For more than half the year Lima has a peculiar climate. It is never cold enough to have a fire, but usually cold enough to make you wish for one. It never rains, but is never dry; that is to say, it is not wet enough to make one hold up an umbrella,yet wet enough to soak one’s clothes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Miraflores on the three occasions we passed through Lima, in an airbnb, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://lionbackpackers.com/&quot;&gt;Lion Backpackers Hostel&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/pe/190-la-casa-de-alvaro.en-gb.html?aid=357026;label=gog235jc-hotel-XX-pe-190NlaNcasaNdeNalvaro-unspec-co-com-L%3Aen-O%3Aabn-B%3Achrome-N%3AXX-S%3Abo-U%3AXX-H%3As;sid=7c3395775e805949feadf9a42f609d7e;dist=0&amp;#x26;group_adults=4&amp;#x26;group_children=0&amp;#x26;no_rooms=1&amp;#x26;sb_price_type=total&amp;#x26;type=total&amp;#x26;&quot;&gt;Guesthouse La Casa de Alvaro&lt;/a&gt;. We’d been told Miraflores was the place to stay but it was a strange area. There wasn’t much to do except grab some fast food, visit the artesanal markets or sit in a cheap cafe. It was also very noisy and the traffic was insane, drivers insessently honk their horns at one another all day long for no reason. The area mainly came to life at night and it turned out to be an alright place to grab a 2 for 1 pisco sour!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our favourite bits of Miraflores was our two day stay in an Airbnb; we had a fully equipped clean kitchen, which we didn’t have to share, a big comfy bed, a washing machine and we hibernated for two full days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lima has lots of parks spread all over the city. We walked to Parque del Amor which is on the coast; it hosts a big statue of a couple kissing and mosaic benches covered in couples names. We returned to the park with Iz when she arrived in Lima and walked the El Malecon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a wander through Kennedy Park, a central point in Miraflores. It was full of cats and there were signs everywhere advertising adoption of the cats to help the city to care for them. There was also a World Cup Sticker swap, so people were there with stacks of stickers swapping to fill their books, Dan was definitely a little jealous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the walk along the Miraflores coastline, we also hit a shopping centre called Lacomar. It was full of high street stores and set in the face of the cliff. Just outside was a sculpture of Paddington Bear in deepest darkest Peru, we couldn’t resist stopping for a photo.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Historical Centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walking tour in Lima took us to the historical centre. The guide was called Elvis and he’d actually been our guide for our walking tour in Cusco. He tried his best to tell us about Lima but it wasn’t easy when Lima is a very random and grey city. He showed us a few churches, one was called the Basilica of the Vera Cruz, it is believed there is a piece of the cross that Jesus was crucified on in the church. We saw the presidential palace and a marching band come out at one point playing music to the crowd. Initially we were hopeful that the historical centre would charm us into liking Lima after spending a lot of our time in Miraflores, sadly it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the walking tour we wandered into China Town to have some late lunch in a Chifa. The guide told us that there is a huge Chinese influence and culture within Peru as Chinese people had been brought over for cheap labour a long time ago, after slavery had been abolished and African people had been liberated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Barranco&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d heard Barranco was the hipster neighbourhood of Lima so went there to drink craft beers and cocktails in the hipster bars. Unlike other hipster areas in cities we had been to in Latin America, Barranco was a poor attempt! There wasn’t much street art in the area and although there were lots of bars, we felt like we could have been anywhere. We had a few Pisco Sours in the area and ate more Lomo Saltado in a nice restaurant called &lt;a href=&quot;http://isolina.pe/&quot;&gt;Isolina&lt;/a&gt;. Although the area wasn’t great our meal did not disppoint!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdict on Lima&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word to describe Lima would be grey. For a capital city, even in Latin America, it seemed behind the times. It wasn’t very pretty and seemed to be more of a hub for people going to more exciting destinations in Peru. This is exactly what we used Lima for and it served its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Huanchaco, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Yoga is not about touching your toes, it is what you learn on the way down.” Jigar Gor Yoga & Surfing Huanchaco is a little town in Peru…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//huanchaco/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//huanchaco/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yoga is not about touching your toes, it is what you learn on the way down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jigar Gor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yoga &amp;#x26; Surfing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huanchaco is a little town in Peru along the coast, not too far from the city of Trujillo. Our hostel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atmahuanchaco.com&quot;&gt;ATMA Hostel &amp;#x26; Yoga&lt;/a&gt; offered both daily yoga lessons and surfing equipment for free. The waves were absolutely huge and neither of us fancied being thrown off the boards in the milder weather, so we opted out of surfing and used our time to chill out by the coast. ATMA was possibly the best hostel we’d stayed in in Peru and it was also home to a cat called Fiddle, a turtle called Donoco and three very fluffy bunnies who had free reign of the courtyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t a lot to do in Huanchaco and we had been warned that the beaches weren’t great and were full of litter. The sand was very dark and it definitely wasn’t the kind of beach we’d sunbathe and relax on. It was such a quiet town, restuarants would shut by 18:00 if they had no customers and there wasn’t even a supermarket. We brought our food from the local ‘Mercardo’ which was incredibly cheap and ate out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/thelighthouserestaurante/&quot;&gt;The Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; two nights in a row. They did incredible wings and kebabs cooked on a barbeque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather was really cold and foggy in the evenings, but we were lucky enough to catch one sunset in Huanchaco! We never actually saw any of the fisherman in their Caballito de Totora boats made from local reeds, but we did get the iconic Huanchaco picture of the boats at sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chan Chan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason we’d ventured so far north, further north than most tourists bother to go, was to see the ancient ruins of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Chan&quot;&gt;Chan Chan&lt;/a&gt; and Kuelap. Sadly Kuelap is in Chachapoyas and we ran out of time to go so far north. However, we did manage to get as far as Chan Chan. In the south of Peru we’d learnt a lot about the Incas but there were other pre-colombian civilisations before the Inca’s, such as the Chimu and the Moche people. Chan Chan was located in between Trujillo and Huanchaco so we caught a public bus for 30p and paid the entrance fee of £1.10, instead of £2.20 because we had ISIC student cards. This was pittance compared to what we paid for Machu Picchu.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan Chan definitely wasn’t as grand as Machu Picchu, however it was much bigger, spanning 20kms in pre-colombian times, 900 - 1470AD! We were offered a guide but they only spoke in Spanish so we decided to wonder around for ourselves. Sadly, there was no information in the site, in either Spanish or English and overall we were a little disappointed with Chan Chan. There is now an ugly roof over the top of the section of the ruins that have been restored in Chan Chan meaning it was impossible to get the iconic photo of the ruins. It also meant we couldn’t walk through all of it and the bamboo posts made it difficult to imagine the areas as rooms, houses, graves and plazas.  However we were able to wander through some parts that hadn’t been restored fully and we managed to get a feel for how big Chan Chan was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Huaca de la Luna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temple of the moon was on the other side of Trujillo and we’d heard his was worth a visit, despite being further away than Chan Chan. Feeling adventurous, we got a bus into Trujillo and then a collectivo to the ruins. We had to wait 45 minutes for a guide in English, as visitors can only see the ruins with a guide, so we wondered around the museum which was full of artifacts excavated from the site. This turned out to be really interesting with all the information about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moche_culture&quot;&gt;Moche&lt;/a&gt; culture and the purpose of Huaca de la Luna in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the temples are referred to as Huaca de la Luna and Huaca del Sol (Temple of the Moon and Temple of the Sun). However, we were only able to visit the Temple of the Moon. The ruins were discovered in the 1990’s and sadly five years ago funding and sponsorship stopped, subsequently archaeologists stopped excavating the site and Huaca del Sol is not open to the public. We were shown around the ruins with our guide who explained that the temples were created between 100-700AD and that the Moche culture used Temple of the Moon for religious purposes. She explained priests ruled their civilizations and that they made annual human sacrifices to the Gods, but also when a natural disaster occurred such as an earthquake or heavy rain as they believed the Gods were angry with them. They did this by having male warriors fight, the loser was stripped naked and brought back to the temple where they were sacrificed. She said their blood was drained first and either poured on the ground or drank by the high priests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temple itself was really well preserved and we were able to see the original colours from the Moche peoples depictions of the decapitated God, who they made sacrifices to. This is because every 100 years the Moche people built over the already existing pyramid to make it bigger, therefore inner pyramids had been covered in sand and kept safe from sunlight and weather. In our opinion this was way more interesting than Chan Chan and definitely worth the £2.20 to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trujillo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d heard mixed reviews about Trujillo, some saying it wasn’t worth visiting and other saying the Plaza de Armas was stunning and worth a quick stop. On our way back from Huaca de la Luna we decided to grab a late lunch from the historical centre of Trujillo. The coloured colonial buildings around the Plaza de Armas reminded us of some parts of Arequipa and we thought the Plaza de Armas was worth the quick visit before jumping on a collectivo back to Huanchaco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Huanchaco&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who surfed seemed to be staying in Huanchaco for at least a couple of weeks, for us it was a nice lazy town where we could rest for a few days before heading back to the bustling city of Lima. We had intended to go further north than Huanchaco to Chachapoyas to visit some more ruins. However, due to cramming in the Amazon Rainforest (no regrets there) Huanchaco was as far north in Peru as we’d get. The Temple of the Moon was definitely worth a visit and for the price so was Chan Chan!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Huaraz, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“A lake is the landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature.

&lt;p&gt;“A lake is the landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature. It is earth’s eye; looking into which he beholder measures the depth of his own nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry David Thoreau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Huaraz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took an overnight bus from Lima to Huaraz which left at 21:30 and dumped us in Huaraz at 06:30. Very disorientated and tired, as there was more than one snorer on the bus, we tried to find our hostel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/pe/vacahouse-huaraz-b-b.en-gb.html?aid=357026;label=gog235jc-hotel-XX-pe-vacahouseNhuarazNbNb-unspec-pe-com-L%3Aen-O%3AwindowsS10-B%3Achrome-N%3AXX-S%3Abo-U%3AXX-H%3As;sid=afa45bdb0846f6aa56e77743f5f154c6;dist=0&amp;#x26;sb_price_type=total&amp;#x26;type=total&amp;#x26;&quot;&gt;Vacahouse B&amp;#x26;B&lt;/a&gt;. However, we didn’t realise there was more than one so around an hour and a cheap motortaxi ride later we managed to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huaraz itself is a small city and it isn’t very touristy, it’s more of a hub for people who are trekking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huascar%C3%A1n_National_Park&quot;&gt;Huascaran National Park&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also 3052 meters above sea level, up in the Andes, so we were also conscious to take it easy at first to avoid altitude sickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mercado Central de Huaraz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the Plaza de Armas, which was home to a crumbling derelict church, there really wasn’t a lot to see in the city. However, we’d read a few blogs that said the market was worth a visit. We’d been to a few of these in South America and you’d think we’d have learnt our lesson; mostly they contain fruit, strange herbal medicines and smelly unrefridgerated meat. Mercardo Central de Huaraz was no different, we pretty much ran through it holding our noses, stopping for a quick picture of the skinned and gutted guinea pigs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Laguna 69&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d been warned by a friend who had previously done this hike that it was difficult because of the altitude. His exact words were “Laguna 69 trek, it may kill you but worth it”. We booked a tour, mainly because it was easier and the same price as getting there by public transport. We were picked up at 05:00 and taken for breakfast in the middle of nowhere on the way before making our way to the starting point for the hike. Laguna 69 is located in Huascaran National Park and reaches 4604 meters above sea level. We started the hike at around 3800 meters and the first hour was pretty flat, the only challenge was getting around the cows blocking the paths.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came our first climb, it was reassuring that people on our tour muttered “it’s hard” as we kept crossing each other on the path. Due to the altitude, we had less oxygen and less energy so every step up was effort. Dan reached the top before me and I thought we’d made it. But it turned out we were about halfway and we’d reached a green coloured lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were graced with a break in climbing, as we crossed along another flat part of the hike before the even steeper climb up to Laguna 69. We managed to spot a Viscacha, which are rodents native to South America, they look like a cross between a rabbit and a squirrel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last climb up was even more effort, we and everyone who’d kept our pace, had to keep stopping every 4-5 meters to catch their breath. The altitude made the hike so much harder, but we got a final burst of energy when a guide told us we were about five minutes from the top.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were so pleased when we saw the blue water and we knew we’d made it. We were told it would take us around three hours to get to the top but we did it in two hours and forty five minutes, it took some of the others three and a half hours to get to the top. We took lots of photo’s and ate our picnic lunch just as it started to hail, ready for the two hour walk back down. Because it had been raining whilst we were at the top, the paths on the way down had turned into streams but we didn’t care as the 7km walk down was so much easier than the climb up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Huaraz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mainly visited Huaraz to hike to Laguna 69 and we were glad we did. It was the hardest hike we’d done (ever) but it was worth it for the views of the sapphire blue lake and the stunning scenery in Huascaran National Park.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ica, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“All journeys have secret destinations of which the traveller is unaware.” Martin Buber.

&lt;p&gt;“All journeys have secret destinations of which the traveller is unaware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Buber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Huacachina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t actually stay in Ica, opting to stay instead by a little oasis in the desert called Huacachina, just outside of Ica.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainly people come here to ride the sand dunes in a sand buggy and to sandboard. There wasn’t a lot to do here other than this, so we stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/pe/il-vecchio-bungalows.en-gb.html?aid=357026;label=gog235jc-hotel-XX-pe-ilNvecchioNbungalows-unspec-pe-com-L%3Aen-O%3AwindowsS10-B%3Achrome-N%3AXX-S%3Abo-U%3AXX-H%3As;sid=9474d9d1bdb38f3e4d3c5b8158430d7d;dist=0&amp;#x26;sb_price_type=total&amp;#x26;type=total&amp;#x26;&quot;&gt;Rochabus Hostel&lt;/a&gt; which had a pool and some hammocks to fill our free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sandboarding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked our sandboarding trip through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.findlocaltrips.com/&quot;&gt;Find Local Trips&lt;/a&gt; which came recommended by the Bolivia/Peru Hop buses, it also appeared to be good value for money. At around 16:00 we strapped into our 14 seater buggy and headed for the dunes. However, initally our buggy got turned away and went back into town, the driver picked up his wife and kid. It seemed that we hadn’t been allowed up there as the buggy wasn’t full. Eventually we got up the first dune, ready for our rollercoaster ride over the dunes and the buggy was super slow. After messing around with it for 10-15 minutes, the driver gave up and called for another buggy; not a great start! The second one was tiny, there was only really room for four people in the back but it had five straps so we had to squeeze in, we didn’t see any other buggy’s with five in the back. The driver didn’t seem to care and he drove up and down the dunes whilst we bumped around squished in the back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we reached the first dune to sandboard down, it was steep but wasn’t so high. We had great fun and then went down two smaller ones but pumped full of adrenaline we hoped that they’d get higher! We got back in the buggy, the driver raced up and down the dunes but a few minutes later the axel for the back wheels bent. The driver looked really annoyed but we figured it was because they’d shoved too many of us in the buggy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to wait there for around 15 minutes for yet another buggy, we couldn’t sandboard as we couldn’t get back up the dune and the sun was setting fast. An even smaller buggy came and we squashed in to race up the dunes to catch the sunset. As the driver pulled up the sun sank behind the dunes, we’d missed it! We couldn’t believe our bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nazca Lines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazca is two and a half hours away from Huacachina so we caught a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cruzdelsur.com.pe/&quot;&gt;Cruz del Sur&lt;/a&gt; bus there and back. These were double the price of the public bus (£6 one way) but they were quicker, more reliable and we were able to watch a film. Historically there have been lots of accidents with flights going over the Nazca Lines, so we did a lot of research and went with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.movilair.com.pe/en/&quot;&gt;Movil Air&lt;/a&gt; who we’d read had newer planes, more experienced pilots and their planes were bigger, holding twelve passengers not six. We checked in at the ‘airport’ but were sent off in a group of six; we were given a map of the lines and realised we’d been shoved with a different plane company, Air Brag.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plane was really small and we had to wear headphones. We’d already been told that the planes tip left and right which can make people sick, so we’d taken anti-sickness tablets before and hadn’t eaten all day, just in case. Before take off, Dan saw an error message come up ‘transponder failed’, the pilot cleared it and continued to the runway. This did not fill us with confidence! We took off and saw each of the ancient geoglyphs from the sky. The plane tipped from side to side so everyone got a good view and it wasn’t long until the woman sat behind me chundered into her sick bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geoglyphs are thought to be from the Nazca culture, between 500 BC and 500 AD. Archaeologists, historians, and mathematicians have all tried to determine the purpose of the Nazca lines; they hypothise that they were either made for the Gods, they are related to astronomy or were created to summon water. Either way they were pretty cool to see from the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a bit of turbulence in the little plane which felt so much worse than in a big aircraft. We loved seeing the amazing geoglyphs from the air and for £65 the flight was well worth it, but were very pleased to have our feet on the ground again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Ica&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mainly went to Ica to stay in Huacachina for some adrenaline filled sandboarding and sand buggying; sadly this didn’t really happen due to two of the buggy’s breaking on us! The Nazca Lines however did not disappoint and to fly in such a small plane over the geoglyphs was another thing ticked off the bucket list.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Amazon Rainforest, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“It seems to me that the natural world is the greatest source of excitement the greatest source of visual beauty the greatest source of…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//the-amazon-rainforest/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//the-amazon-rainforest/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It seems to me that the natural world is the greatest source of excitement the greatest source of visual beauty the greatest source of intellectual interest. It is the greatest source of so much in life that makes life worth living.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Attenborough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iquitos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing in Iquitos was a bit of a shock to the system, as soon as we walked outside we were swarmed by local taxi and motortaxi drivers offering to take us into Iquitos for various amounts of money. It was the most we had been harassed since arriving in South America, including on Copcabana Beach! We managed to find an offical taxi driver who weaved in and out of the traffic to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hospedajeneydita.com/&quot;&gt;Hostel Neydita&lt;/a&gt; where we were staying. The traffic was crazy; there were families of four balanced on one motorcycle, women breastfeeding their children on motorcycles and people sat in plastic chairs in the trailers attached to the motorcycles. We later learned that as Iquitos is only accessible by air or by a very long boat journey, there is a Honda motorcycle factory in the city where people can buy one for less than S./3000 (£672).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Belen Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were picked up in the morning by our guide, Osmar from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iquitos-tour.com/en/jungle-tours-Libertad&quot;&gt;Libertad Lodge&lt;/a&gt; where we would be staying in the Amazon for four days. We picked the lodge as it seemed to be good value for money; we could make our own itinerary, the money went towards helping the local community and there wasn’t a single bad review on Tripadvisor out of hundreds. It cost us $350 each (around £280) for three nights and four days all inclusive. We broke up the three hour journey there by firstly visiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lonelyplanet.com/peru/iquitos/attractions/belen/a/poi-sig/1277432/363385&quot;&gt;Belen Market&lt;/a&gt;. We had read that it was one of South America’s most bizarre markets, with all sorts of strange things for sale in ‘Shaman’s Alley’, such as monkeys hands, bird beaks, snake skins and ayahuasca by the bottle. Ayahuasca is a plant that has hallucagenic properties said to heal all sorts of problems when used by a Shaman; lots of tourists come to Peru to experience ayahuasca ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Osmar showed us around and pointed out all the tropical fruits and vegetables. He then took us around the part where people were selling meat; the weirdest thing we saw was a turtle without its shell, which people apparently eat. After getting to know Osmar a little better and how much he loves animals, we knew this was the reason why he didn’t take us to see anything really strange and in the end we were grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Dallas World Aquarium; Amazon Rescue Centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dwazoo.com/conservations/peru/centro-de-rescate-amazonico-amazon-rescue-center/&quot;&gt;The Amazon Rescue Centre&lt;/a&gt; started up ten years ago for rescued manatee’s and is now funded by Dallas University. For S/.20 (£5) each a guide showed us around and introduced us to all of the rescued animals they have there. He explained that the animals they have in CREA are rescued from local people who had them as pets. He explained that they are rehabilitated and then put back into the wild when they are deemed ready by biologists. We saw a two month old ocelot, a type of big cat, she was very cute and playful. Its owners had given her up when she started to bite. There were also two scartlett macaws there who had been mistreated, they guarded all of the rescued turtles. The guide demonstrated this by entering the pen and trying to pick up the turtles, the macaws chased him threatening to bite until he left the turtles alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also rescued otters, my favourite animal! One was only a baby and the guide said that his owners had caught him when he was young and never taught him to swim. He explained that they are currently giving him swimming lessons but he cries when he is ready to come out of the water!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also sloths and lots of monkeys. Sadly, the guide told us that once monkeys had become domesticated and dependent on humans, because of how smart they are, they are not able to rehabilitate them back to the wild completely. The guide explained that they go to places such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://laisladelosmonos.org/&quot;&gt;Monkey Island&lt;/a&gt; where they are able to live in the rainforest, but tourists visit and give them food. Lastly we saw the manatee’s; there were three. The guide told us there are more but they are closer to being released so are in the rehabilitation centre. He explained that rehabilitation takes three years in total for each manatee and in ten years they have successfully rehabilitated around twenty. There was one manatee isolated in his own pool, the guide said that he had been found with a plastic bag in his stomach which he had swallowed due to it being in all the vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide told us that although they are a rescue centre, their main purpose is to educate the local children. He said when children come to visit they talk about the exotic pets they have at home at the beginning of their visit, but by the end they know that it is wrong and that the animals should be free. He said many of the children actually come back with their parents to donate their pets to the centre. The guide explained that the older generation are stuck in their ways and will continue to hunt manatee and kill turtles for meat, but that they hope educating the younger generation will help make a difference to the animals of the rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Libertad Lodge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a two hour drive and an hour and a half on a motorboat, we finally reached Libertad Village. The lodge was on stilts due to the flooding during rainy season, however we were visiting just at the end, so although it was muddy we could walk on the land around the lodge. We had a cute bungalow with a bathroom and most importantly a mosquito net! The village is located in the Pacaya Samira National Reserve and there are around 350 people living in the village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Searching for sloths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we headed out on our boat to look for three-toed sloths. We found one pretty quickly hanging down from the tree. The guide told us all about them, how they move around four different trees a day and will come down once a week to defecate under the tree it lives in to help to fertilise it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dolphins at sunset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up doing this twice, but we were lucky enough to spot Amazon river dolphins every time we went into the Rio Ucayali near the lodge. There were two types, pink  which were shyer, had a longer snout and a rounder dorsel fin, and grey tucuxi dolphins which were more playful and easier to spot. We sat with the motor off for a long time watching the pink sunset turn the murky water lilac, with the dolphins popping up out of the water all around us. At one point, Manuel one of our drivers, did donuts in the water in the boat to disturb the fish and get the dolphins closer to us. There were parts of the water we could swim in but the water was so murky and knowing that there were piranha, water snakes and stingrays in there, neither of us were brave enough to take a dunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tarantulas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had expected to go hunting for tarantula and got ready in our wellies, long sleeves and headtorches for a night hike, but it turned out there were lots of tarantula on the other side of the village. Peruvian pinktoe tarantulas; they live in the trees so we didn’t have to get too close. We got a few pictures and our guide asked if we wanted to hold one, he told us that they bite and can be venomous but mostly to paralyse their prey such as insects and that their hairs are just irritating to human skin. We weren’t sure if he was joking but said no as we didn’t fancy getting bitten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hiking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent a lot of time in the rainforest on our boat. As it was the end of rainy season, the local rainforest was ‘flooded forest’. We did however do a couple of hours hiking when we managed to find some land. Firstly, Manuel our driver had to navigate through a creek, because the creeks were drying out, there were lots of logs and tree roots to navigate through. At one point the boat got stuck on a tree stump and I thought it was going to tip over; both guides had to get out in their wellies to dislodge it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land was muddy and in parts flooded. On foot, we managed to spot some common squirrel monkey’s and red howler monkeys. Even Manuel got really excited when we spotted the red howler’s as these are really hard to find. Whilst we were walking, Osmar had a bullet ant on his boot and Manuel managed to get it off with his machete before he was bitten. The guide explained that bullet ant bites are supposed to be really painful for 24 hours. Osmar also showed us a fruit with a grub inside and said we could eat it. When we both said we were full he ate it and said it tasted like coconut. He also collected some mocambo fruits which he said we could try on the way back and he would roast the nuts on the inside for us with our dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monkeys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back, the guide opened some of the mocambo fruits for us to try. They were stringy and pretty tasteless. Manuel pulled in towards some trees, we weren’t sure why until a monkey jumped in the boat, sat on our laps and started helping herself to the mocambo fruit in Dan’s hand! Two more then joined in. The guide told us that they were common woolly monkey’s and they had been rescued from a market by the local people. He said that although they could collect their own fruits and nuts, whenever they heard an engine, they knew it was the sound of humans which meant food and they would come down to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They absolutely loved scooping the flesh out of the mocambo fruit and when they had finished they cuddled up together on the guides lap before coming over and doing the same on ours. They were really soft and their tails were like an extra arm, wrapping around things. It was such a great surprise and Osmar and Manuel had clearly had it planned all along!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw lots of different types of monkey’s during our time in the Amazon. We spotted a few monk saki monkey’s, titi monkeys and some capuchins high in the tree tops and the guide took us to a spot where some pygmy marmoset monkeys lived, the smallest type of monkey in South America. We watched one licking the tree sap. We also saw some owl monkeys, they’re nocturnal so the guide had to hit the tree with a vine to get them to come out and see what was going on. The monkey’s were  either small, so quick or so high up in the tree tops it made it almost impossible to get a good photo unless we had invested in an expensive lens as long as our arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Searching for caiman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were nervous about looking for caiman at night, especially in the lodges tiny boats and because Osmar had said we’d try and catch one. Manuel drove the boat through a small creek and after a while we hit a lot of vegetation, mostly lillipads and water lettuce. This also meant lots of insects, there were thousands of them. Because of the light from our headtorches there were mosquitos and flies in our faces and grasshoppers, spiders, crickets and frogs were all jumping in the boat. The thick vegetation was building up at the front of the boat preventing us from going anywhere and we knew there were caiman in the water. After the ordeal was over, we asked the guide about the big spider’s we’d seen, he said they were wandering spiders but the aquatic kind not the deadly ones to humans. He told us they often find water snakes in the vegetation too which get lifted up towards the boat, luckily this hadn’t happened to us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osmar told us we were looking for red eyes in the vegetation and it wasn’t long before he found a baby caiman. He told us we could hold it but with the crickets, frogs and mosquitos buzzing and hopping around us we decided not to. He told us a little about them and said its mother would be somewhere in the vegetation too. The black caiman can grow up to six meters long and Osmar told us about the time he had been bitten by a small caiman on his hand. We were pleased when we came out of caiman territory and able to relax on the boat ride back to the lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunrise in the Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We woke up at 05:00 to see the sunrise over Rio Ucayali. Although it was cloudy, there was a gap and when the sun came up it was really orange. Some of the dolphins were about swimming around the boat again. Osmar explained on a good day the sun is really big and lights up the whole of the river. We were happy with the sunrise we’d experienced and crawled back into bed for a siesta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fishing for piranha&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went on a day excursion with Osmar and Roland, one of the chef’s in the lodge and a local fisherman. We saw a few lakes and found some land to cook lunch. He made a fire and cooked us rice, chicken and fried plantane. It was delicious, it then absolutely poured it down so it looked like we were out of luck and couldn’t spend the afternoon fishing. There was thunder and lightening and after waiting a while we gave up and headed back to the Lodge. However, it stopped on the way back so Roland pulled into some fishing spots for us to try and catch some dinner. Between us we caught six catfish and a red-bellied piranha.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d been told that once there was a bite to lift the rod up sharply to get the fish into the boat, however when Dan caught the piranha, as he flicked the rod into the air it wriggled off of the hook and hit me in the back. They were really mean looking and Osmar told us to be careful as they would bite and take a chunk of flesh. Roland later cooked them up for dinner, although they were small the meat on them was really tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Snakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d been to a lake hunting for snakes basking in the trees but we hadn’t managed to find any. Osmar told us that snakes are very random, on some days he sees none and on others two or three. On the last day he told us he had a surprise for us, we’d gotten used to Osmar and his surprises and usually they didn’t disappoint. He took us around Libertad Village, the kids started to follow us and Osmar told us we were at Roland’s house. Underneath was a wooden box and Osmar said that Roland had caught a three metre long boa constrictor. He explained that it had been caught up in his fishing net, so they had freed it and Roland was waiting for it’s scars to heal before releasing it back into the wild. The kids gathered around underneath the house whilst Omar took the nails out of the top of the box to get it out. It immediately started hissing and going for Osmar and Roland, it sounded angry. When they did manage to get it out you could see how powerful it was and how hard they had to work to stop it from wrapping around their arms and squeezing tightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on the Amazon Rainforest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We absolutely loved the Amazon! It was really relaxing to spend four days without technology, eating local tropical fruits and going out everyday to see animals in the wild. Even though we ended up with more than 100 mosquito bites altogether (we now look like we have chicken pox) and at times were covered in bugs, feeding monkeys and being surrounded by dolphins at sunset was absolutely incredible. We can’t thank Libertad Lodge, our guide Osmar and the locals enough for having us, allowing us to stay in their village and taking us out on their boats to see some of the wildlife in the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cusco, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“The word that most perfectly describes the city of Cusco is evocative.

&lt;p&gt;“The word that most perfectly describes the city of Cusco is evocative. Intangible dust of another era settles on its streets, rising like the disturbed sediment of a muddy lake when you touch its bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Che Guevara&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cusco City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cusco is a really charming city, it sits in a valley surrounded by hills with a huge Plaza de Armas and lots of cobbled narrow streets in the centre. We arrived on an overnight bus from Arequipa with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cruzdelsur.com.pe/&quot;&gt;Cruz del Sur&lt;/a&gt; for £29, pricey for Peru but it was the best overnight bus we’d been on so far! We had our own TV, choice of movie and a VIP lounge in the bus station which included sofas and a clean toilet. We stayed in the Santiago District in a hostel called &lt;a href=&quot;http://hostelincusco.com/&quot;&gt;Tayta Wasi&lt;/a&gt;, it was a big room with hot water, at £7 each a night it was great value for money too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our second day in Cusco we did a free walking tour. The guide talked a lot about the Spanish conquest; how the people that had been living in Cusco at the time had been a civilised nation but that the Spanish did not portray them in this way. He said the Spanish described them as naked savages but he pointed out in Cusco it’s too cold to be naked. Cusco was the centre of the Inca Empire which stretched from Colombia to Chile. The guide explained why llama were so important; they can carry 60kg and walk all day so without llama the Incas would not have been able to conquer their territory so quickly. The guide was passionate about Cusco’s history but even more so about football in Peru. He said that their best player was Guerrero but he had been suspended for taking a banned substance. His suspension was under appeal which would be decided before the World Cup squads could be announced but they were hopeful Guerrero would be available for selection, he acutally received a 14 month ban (FYI, Dan added this bit in).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were going to visit a white Jesus statue at the top of the hill but we were told it was S./130 to visit by the couple from New York we met on the Inca Jungle. We later found out that this wasn’t the case and it was free to visit, but it was too late to go up there by then. Instead we visited San Cristobal Church for a view of Cusco City. It took us a while to hobble up the stairs to the church as our legs ached from Machu Picchu and we continued to hobble about for four days after. There were a few llama and some ladies selling their crafts at San Cristobal, it was nice to sit somewhere peaceful and watch the city below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;San Pedro Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Pedro is a market in the middle of Cusco city, it was designed by the same man who designed the Eiffel Tower, Gustave Eiffel. However it’s definitely not as impressive! The market contained mostly food; fruit, vegetables, medicinal plants and unrefrigerated meat! We thought it was horrific until we later drove through a street full of dead pigs for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also visited San Pedro on our walking tour; the guide told us about a cactus plant, Hauchuma. People who live in the Andes believe Huachuma can help cure almost all mental health problems. He explained that people who live in the mountains use natural plants and rarely visit the doctor. People take Hauchuma just before they go to sleep and then have very vivid dreams due to the plants hallucegenic properties. When they wake they are cured of things like depression, anxiety, doubts and have answers to their questions about life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Casa Concha Museum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casa Concha Museum is in an old colonial building in the centre of the city. It contains items from Machu Picchu that were collected by Hiram Bingham, not the first person to find it, but the first to make a scientific discovery of it in 1912. The Peruvians we met evidently disliked Hiram Bingham and referred to him as a ‘treasure hunter’ not as a scientist. They believe that he stole the Inca Gold that would have been buried with the mummies in Machu Picchu, as lots of Inca Gold later arrived on the black market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information in the museum put a lot of what we had seen at Machu Picchu in context. The Museum also had information about how the Incas shaped babies skulls as it was more desirable for their skulls to be long, and there were human bones among the pottery on display. There were lots of chicha cases, something we are yet to try! The Incas were apparently big fans of alcohol and made beer from corn. They fermented it by chewing the corn and spitting it into a big clay vase. Apparently it’s not made like this anymore but people still drink chicha.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum explained that scientists believe that Machu Picchu was a country retreat for the Inca King and his family. They believe that it wasn’t an important place as the Spanish did not destroy or build on top of it, as they did everywhere else, and it is not on a main route of the Inca Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Qorikancha&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the most important temple in Inca Empire, it’s a Quechua word meaning gold enclosure. It was originally a temple dedicated to Inti, the sun god but was destroyed and looted during the Spanish conquest. It’s foundations were used to build the Church of San Domingo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t much to see actually inside Qorikancha in regards to the Incas; it was full of religious art from the church. However the stone blocks forming the part of the building of the Inca Temple was similar to those we had seen of the temples of Machu Picchu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shopping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were so many colourful llama items in Cusco and it was so cheap; S./25 (£5.65) for a jumper, S./5 (£1.13) for socks and S./50 (£11.30) for giant blankets, we couldn’t resist and in the end brought so much we had to pay to post most of it back home in a box!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chinchero, Maras &amp;#x26; Moray&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinchero, Maras and Moray are all outside of Cusco and we visited them on a day trip. The first stop was Chinchero where we visited an indigenous family; they showed us how they cook and make textiles. Dan and I were really distracted by the guinea pig hutches which were full of the squeaky creatures, not kept as pets but for food! They are raised for at least six months before they are eaten and guinea pig is (an expensive) local delicacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moray was a site used by the Inca’s as a laboratory to test where vegetables, fruits and medicinal plants grow best. It consists of rings that get higher and higher which changes the temperature and the altitude. The guide explained that the Incas grew different things at different heights using different types of soil so they knew where best to grow their crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maras is a salt mine that is still working today and provides most of southern Peru with its salt. The salty water, which has a higher content of salt than sea water, it is believed comes from a volcano as it is also warm, but this isn’t known for definite. Families own pools in the mine and can get hundreds of kilos of salt out of a pool in a year. The different colours are down to the content of salt and this is dependent on the water evaporating by the sun. The mine was used in Inca times although it is believed that was not as big as it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Food &amp;#x26; drinks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered Peruvian food in Arequipa but it just seemed to get better and better. Our first stop was &lt;a href=&quot;http://jackscafecusco.com&quot;&gt;Jack’s Cafe&lt;/a&gt; which was in Cusco six years ago when I first visited, they do the most amazing breakfasts. We went there twice, once for a full English and once for American Pancakes. We ate at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cuzcoeats.com/pollo-la-brasa-urban-perus-favorite-food/&quot;&gt;Los Todos Pollo&lt;/a&gt; twice too, a place where you can get a massive 1/4 chicken and chips for S./16, just under £4, Dan’s favourite! We had a curry at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/KormaSutraCusco&quot;&gt;Korma Sutra&lt;/a&gt;; Alpaca chilli and mango which was delicious and we tried their tandoori fried cuy. The meat was a little chewy; like chicken thigh and luckily the guinea pig didn’t have a head! We had Peruvian Chinese at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cuscorestaurants.com/restaurant/kion/&quot;&gt;Kion&lt;/a&gt; which was probably the best meal we’d had so far in Peru, arroz chaufas and spicy noodles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again we had more than our fill of Pisco Sours as there seemed to be happy hour everywhere all day! We went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theonlyperuguide.com/peru-guide/cusco/nightlife/mama-africas/&quot;&gt;Mama Africa&lt;/a&gt;, a club that offered free salsa lessons, but again Dan couldn’t be convinced to dance salsa. However, we did go there after a bit later on; people were dancing on the bar to reggaeton music and had their faces painted. We definitely have a song of South America now too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Cusco&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We loved this city and we were gutted we couldn’t spent longer there. There were so many things we didn’t have time to do; a tour of the Sacred Valley, Sacsaywaman, Rainbow Mountain and there were lots of churches and museums we didn’t have time to explore. Cusco, we’ll be back!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Inca Jungle, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“I’m struggling here, if I’m honest with you.

&lt;p&gt;“I’m struggling here, if I’m honest with you. I don’t know how to sell it with… Do you like llamas?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Pilkington on Machu Picchu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inca Jungle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked the Inca Jungle before we left the UK, as we knew that some of the treks get booked up months in advance to Machu Picchu, mainly the four day classic Inca Trail. We booked Inca Jungle with &lt;a href=&quot;http://lokihostel.com/en/travel&quot;&gt;Loki Travel&lt;/a&gt;, we were sceptical as they have a reputation for being a party hostel, however the Inca Jungle was cheaper than elsewhere, £186 all inclusive. We didn’t fancy hiking on the four day classic Inca Trail and the Inca Jungle seemed a little more adventurous. We decided on the three day Inca Jungle, the classic one is four days, but this meant we missed out the day of hiking and instead we’d get a taxi to catch up with the four day group that left the day before us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to be at Loki Hostel for 06:30AM, which was a killer as it was the other side of Cusco to where we were staying. We were driven to Ollytaytambo to get some final things we might need; Dan and I had been prepared and had everything we needed but couldn’t resist the overpriced Dairy Milk Caramel in the shop. We then drove for another hour and a half to the top of Alba Malaga Pass, a 4800 metre mountain which we were going to bike down.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was the safety gear; helmet, body armour, gloves, knee pads and a visibility jacket. The guide told us that the minivan would drive behind the group for safety reasons and he talked us through the nine gears on the bike and how to break safety. The ride was 50km with 90% of it being downhill and 10% of it flat, it had sheer drops and blind corners with lorries driving up and down. The guide mentioned biking through streams but we were on a main road so we thought he was joking. It was an easy bike ride in the sense that we didn’t have to pedal and just had to keep putting the breaks on for the corners. However, after the ‘halfway point’ we got lower and closer to the jungle so not only did it get so much hotter but we found out the guide wasn’t joking and we had to bike through streams over the road so we ended up soaked! It was surprisingly good fun and Dan and I managed to beat the rest of he group to the bottom!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short drive later we were in Santa María where the people who were doing the four day Inca jungle would be spending the night. As we’d opted for the three days, we had lunch there before getting our taxi to Santa Teresa to meet the other group. We had the option of rafting but I didn’t fancy it and Dan wanted to watch  the Champions League instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taxi turned out to be awful! The driver had so many cracks in his windscreen it was surprising he could see out of it at all. There were two locals in the taxi too, which made it a squeeze, and the driver blared his music the entire thirty minute drive. The gravelly road from Santa María to Santa Teresa was only wide enough for one car with a sheer drop at the one side and at one point he nearly crashed into the mountain. Eventually we arrived in Santa Teresa and no one really had a clue what was happening. The other half of the group and the guide were going to be arriving around four hours after us and we had been told to either wait at the lodge or head to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portalmachupicchu.com/en/things-to-do/hot-springs/hot-spring-of-santa-teresa/259/&quot;&gt;Banos Termales de Cocalmayo&lt;/a&gt; where we could try and find them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed straight to Cocalmayo hot springs and after a short walk in the wrong direction we managed to find it. The sun had gone down and after a long day it was amazing to relax in the hot water. The springs actually seemed clean and the water was clear too which made a change to the hot springs we’d been to in Bolivia. Once our fingers were like prunes we got out but showered in the hot spring showers first as we knew the hostel would only have cold water.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 20:30 the guide and the rest of the group arrived at the hostel. The guide told us we’d missed a great day hiking where the other group had tried lots of medicinal plants, coffee and Cuy (Guinea Pig). However, it seemed a little ironic that that evening the guy from New York was really sick and he seemed to think it was all the weird plants he’d felt obligated to try on the hike. The guide made us try his medicinal tea which apparently could cure most health problems, it was really bitter. He then somehow convinced us to sign up to the ziplining the following morning. After dinner he gave us a shot of Inca Tequila but Loki’s party reputation didn’t seem to be holding up and we were in bed by 21:00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were up at 06:30 to do the ziplining with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294314-d3849665-Reviews-Zipline_Inka_Flyer_Santa_Teresa-Cusco_Cusco_Region.html&quot;&gt;Inca Flyer&lt;/a&gt;; 3km, 5 ziplines and a suspension bridge in the trees. We had to sign a waiver first to acknowledge that health and safety may not be the same as in our own country and that it was a risky activity and we may die. This totally filled us with confidence. We got to the first zipline which was over a huge valley and the Urubamba River. The only test was sending over one of the members of staff and we were then quickly shown how to break and told the guide would hold a yellow sign to slow down and red to break. In order to do this we had to hold onto the wire with our leather gloves on, compared to the zipline we had done in Wales the previous year this didn’t at all seem safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of people had gone it was our turn, luckily we survived unharmed and had great fun. By the fifth one Dan seemed to have forgotten his fear of heights and did the line like ‘Spiderman’, upside down!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full of adrenaline we decided to do the suspension bridge too which ended up being really scary! We had to walk along the rotting planks of wood up in the treetops and when we reached certain parts we had to balance unhook and hook our safety clips around the frame of he bridge. This was whilst other people were on the bridge making it wobble!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed straight towards Machu Picchu after this for our hike from the Hydroelectric station to Aguas Calientes, which was around three hours and along the train tracks. We didn’t realise until some time in, that the trains actually still drive on the line and constantly beeped to get people to move off and out of the way. We’d got talking to a couple from New York and a guy from Romania and as we were faster than the others our guide told us all to walk ahead but meet him and the rest of the group at the first carriages. We got there in under an hour and decided to go in the bar opposite for a drink and some shade whilst we waited for the rest. We waited for 45 minutes but there was no sign of the group so we decided to carry on walking and had to ring Loki when we got phone signal. Once we got to Agues Calientes we caught up with our guide and the rest of the group, who hadn’t bothered to check if we were in the bar when they got to the carriages and they’d carried on ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was then a massive dispute over the rooms. Three couples refused to share dorms but hadn’t paid for a private room; they were exceptionally rude to our guide. After a very awkward five minutes they agreed to pay more and went to another hostel. The rest of us weren’t fussed about where we slept and ended up each having rooms of our own now anyway. Dan and I started to put our bed bug guards on our beds and then we saw them. Bed bugs! One of the beds was infested they were in between the blankets and on the sheets and they looked like head lice. We gathered up our things and threw them into the hallway. We told the guide who was really apologetic, he seemed to be having a really terrible day! We were moved to the other hostel with no extra cost. We later met for our ‘final supper’ as we had a different guide at Machu Picchu, and on the way we had our first close encounter with the Peruvian hairless dog, a black dog with no hair except for a blonde tuft on top of its head. The guide gave us a free Pisco Sour, which helped us get to sleep by 21:30 ready for a 03:45 get up the next morning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the first bus didn’t leave until 05:30, we arrived at 04:20 and there were already a lot of people in front of us. We ate our breakfast in the queue and ignored the fact that it had started to rain. By 05:40 we were on a bus on the way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu&quot;&gt;Machu Picchu&lt;/a&gt;, unfortunately as we got higher there was more cloud and more rain. Not the kind of rain we get in the UK, it was like a rainforest downpour and within minutes our waterproof jackets were soaked through, our waterproof covers on our backpacks failed to work and our waterproof walking boots were soaked too. We managed to find our guide and as half the group hadn’t yet come up we were ushered off with another guide to start our two hour walking tour.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really hard to appreciate Machu Picchu’s magnificence to begin with as we were tired, cold, soaked, the rain wasn’t easing up and half of Machu Picchu was covered in cloud. Our guide walked us through the ruined city, pointing out the temples, sacrificial stones, the school and explaining how they cut the stone. Even in the pouring rain, our guide remained really upbeat. He also told us that the name Machu Picchu means ‘old mountain’ in Quechua, the universal language at the time of the Incas and that it is actually a reference to the mountain behind the city, not the city itself. He explained no one really knows what the city was actually called. We were also just about able to see Huayna Picchu, meaning ‘young mountain’, both can be climbed for an extra cost but have to be booked months in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one good thing about the rain was that it demonstrated how the Inca drainage systems still worked today, 500 years later. At the end of the tour were two huts with a roof, where we were finally able to get some shelter. By then everything was soaked through and we were dithering, praying the clouds would break and the sun would beam like it had done the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully after around an hour the clouds started to disappear and the rain stopped. We walked the rest of the city on our own before heading out to use the toilet and have some lunch. When we re-entered Machu Picchu we were finally able to have our ‘wow’ moment of the magnificence of Machu Picchu. We went up to the guard house first for the ‘postcard picture’. We had to wait in line at the good spots and at one of them a couple spent ages taking a photo of a cuddly llama in front of Machu Picchu before filming themselves chanting Machu Picchu in their Machu Picchu tshirts. We thought this was a bit much. Another girl did the classic jumping pose and was told off by the guards, not only did they tell her jumping was forbidden but they made her delete her photos!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we walked up to Intipunku (the sun gate), the sun was blaring and it felt like tropical jungle; insect repellent and sun cream was needed! On the forty minute hike to Intipunku there were lots of llamas. The guide had told us that llamas are supposed to live in the highlands for the right diet so they are unhappy as they have the wrong type of grass at Machu Picchu as it is at lower altitude. One of them went a bit rogue as it came up the stairs in between tourists, it almost trod on a little girl and then stormed at two other llamas in the field. The other two ran off and as they were chased they ran into a group of about six people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got great views at Inkipuntu of Machu Picchu and the place was starting to get a quieter as people had taken their photos and were starting to get the buses down. Sadly, Machu Picchu had changed a lot since I last visited six years ago; we were only allowed re-entry once, but the toilet was outside which meant we could only go to the toilet once during our visit. It also had a one way system which meant that we had to follow the arrows and if we took a wrong turn it was bad luck. We’d contemplated going to the Inca Bridge but unfortunately took a wrong turn. Instead we walked around the city unguided taking photos of the bits we hadn’t been able to that morning because of the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus up or down from Machu Picchu to Agues Calientes was $12 (£9) one way. We’d paid to go up but decided to do the hour walk down. It was further than we anticipated and by the last step down our legs were like jelly and our feet felt like they were going to drop off. We also couldn’t work out if they were still wet from the morning or whether they were now just sweaty from the heat. We headed straight to the hostel to change out of our boots before going to get a very late lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our ride back to Cusco was a long one. We had a train to Ollytaytambo at 18:20 which took around an hour and a half and then a two hour bus journey back to Cusco. We’d been told that when we reached Ollytaytambo someone would be there with a sign with our names on. They weren’t but using our atrocious Spanglish we were able to find the right minivan back. By the time we got back to our hostel it was around 23:00 and it had been maybe the longest, but one of the best days of our trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verdict of Inca Jungle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inca Jungle was a really fun and adventurous way to reach Machu Picchu, especially as four days of hiking up and downhill, camping and carrying all of our gear for hundreds of pounds to do the classic Inca Trail didn’t really sound like our thing. Machu Picchu itself was phenomenal, even the second time around, and we were lucky in the end as we saw the drainage systems working in the rain, we were able to take photos up in the clouds and saw the city in the clear sky with the sun beaming down. Machu Picchu definitely deserves its status as one of the seven wonders of the world!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arequipa, Peru]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Being Peruvian means to come from the farthest place possible to get to Europe.

&lt;p&gt;“Being Peruvian means to come from the farthest place possible to get to Europe. Peru is the land of the Incas. It was the capital of South America; it was where the Spanish founded their empire and took over the Inca Empire and made it into a colony of Spain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mario Testino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food, drink and Salsa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take us long to discover the food in Peru is insanely good. With its Asian and European influences, plus recipes from the coast, jungle and mountains the wide range of food is delicious. In Arequipa we managed to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294313-d2411118-Reviews-India_Indian_Cuisine-Arequipa_Arequipa_Region.html&quot;&gt;India Indian Cuisine&lt;/a&gt; for a curry. We had naan, rice, curry and beer for £9 and it was better than some of the curries we’ve had home! Not only was the food good but it was also cheap so we managed to eat out everyday and keep within our budget. We also ate at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294313-d2213103-Reviews-Hatunpa-Arequipa_Arequipa_Region.html&quot;&gt;Hatunpa&lt;/a&gt;, a restuarant that bases their dishes on potatoes. They use seven different types of Andean potatoes and the dishes have toppings. Dan went for Lomo Saltado, beef in a wine sauce and I had beef and sausage, basically a bolognese with cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried ‘queso helado’ on the walking tour, translated cheese ice cream. Thankfully, it’s not cheese flavoured, it’s vanilla but the texture was like cheese, which is where its name comes from. Of course we had our fair share of Pisco Sours, THE Peruvian drink. We went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://museodelpisco.org/&quot;&gt;Museo del Pisco&lt;/a&gt; and tried the classic and passionfruit ones. This was followed by more in a bar called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dejavuaqp.com/&quot;&gt;Deja Vu&lt;/a&gt;. We’d been told on the tour that they offer free salsa lessons, intregued we went to catch the end but it was basically two local men dancing with a European and American girl, whilst their boyfriends sat drinking beer. Not really a salsa lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mummy Juanita is a must do if in Arequipa. Juanita isn’t technically a mummy but she’s the best preserved frozen human in the world. We visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsm.edu.pe/museo-santuarios-andinos/&quot;&gt;Museo Santuarios Andinosto&lt;/a&gt; see her for S/20 (£4.50) and spent an hour in the museum.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juanita was discovered in 1996 and is named the ‘Ice Maiden’. She was discovered at the top of  Mount Ampato and is so well preserved as she had been frozen since her death. She is 550 years old as she died between 1450 and 1480; she is a child offering made by the Incas to their Gods. The Incas believed that the mountains were alive and when earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occurred, the Gods were punishing them. They believed in reciprocation, therefore they thought if they made offerings to the Gods, the Gods in turn would take care of them. The Inca King in Cusco, made the decision about giving an offering and selected the purest and most beautiful children to sacrifice to the Gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juanita was from the Lake Titicaca area of the Inca Empire and she was around 13 years old when she was offered. The Incas walked to the top of the mountain the king had chosen to make the sacrifice to. They gave Juanita coco leaves and corn beer with some hallucagenic drugs so she became intoxicated, she was then killed by the priest with a blow to the head from a mace. We could still see the holes in her head from the blow. The guide in the museum told us that her internal organs are perfectly preserved due to being frozen for 550 years. We also got lucky as Juanita is moved to the dark for 4 months of the year for preservation reasons but she had been brought back out the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El Misti &amp;#x26; Colca Canyon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Christ the Redeemer, the iconic El Misti remained hidden behind clouds for most of our time in Arequipa. On our last afternoon we went up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Las-Terrazas-Hotel-Arequipa-332723616780517/&quot;&gt;Tereazas Arequipa&lt;/a&gt; for a beer and a good view of the plaza. We were going to leave but the waiter told us the sun would be setting and that it is beautiful when it happens. We were easily convinced to stay for a second beer and not only was the sunset stunning over the Plaza de Armas but the clouds also cleared and we finally managed to get a good view of El Misti.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arequipa is surrounded by active volcanos, El Misti is only 15km away and is 5,822 metres high. It lies between mount Chachani and Pichu Pichu volcano. Its last eruption was in 1985. Both El Misti and Chachani can be climbed in a day but as the weather was cloudy and we were saving our energy for Machu Picchu we decided to give the climb a miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colca Canyon had always been on our itinerary until we arrived in Arequipa. We only had time for a day tour due to our trip which was already booked to Machu Picchu. However it was a 3AM pick up followed up a 4-5 hour drive to the Colca Canyon. The weather was also bad which reduces visibility of the canyon and the chances of seeing the Andean Condor. People who had gone said it was better to do the trip ourselves, to stay 2-3 nights and trek around the canyon. In the end we decided against it and slept in and drank pisco instead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;San Camilo Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d heard people rave about Arequipa’s huge San Camilo Market, however we were pretty disappointed. We’re not sure what we were expecting but apart from one row of fresh brightly coloured fruit the market was pretty average; it actually reminded us of the one at the Bullring in Birmingham. It didn’t seem that big and apart from some smoothie stalls the rest was unrefridgerated meat, which is enough to make anyone contemplate being vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;White City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a walking tour in Arequipa but it was awful. The guide spoke really fast and seemed pretty disinterested in what he was talking out. One of the only things we learned was why Arequipa is called the ‘White City’, initially it was because so many white Europeans settled there and the European influence in the city is really evident. At times we felt like we were walking round a city in the Mediterranean. Today it’s known as the ‘White City’ due to the white bricks they use to build with that come from the nearby volcanoes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plaza de Armas was definitely the best part of the city. It was huge and had a colourful garden in the middle, although sadly the fountain was under restoration. The streets surrounding the Plaza were cobbled and made of the same white stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yanahuara&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was supposed to be a good viewpoint of the city in Yanahuara. We had a wander and there were some arches with a plaza and a white church. The view was alright but we weren’t so high up and the volcanoes were hidden by clouds. In the end we actually had better views watching the sunset over Plaza de Armas. However, walking round the Yanahuara neighbourhood was a good way to pass the morning, we saw loads of classic VW Beetles and Dan managed to catch part of a local football game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Llamas and Alpacas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llama’s are really important to Peruvians and are part of people’s history; before the mule LLamas were used for transportation and helped the Inca’s conquer the area. The wool of Llamas, Alpacas, Vicuñas and Guanacos are used for clothes and Llama leather is used to make shoes and bags. We saw loads of these animals all over Arequipa city. We also visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mundoalpaca.com.pe/&quot;&gt;Mundo Alpaca&lt;/a&gt;, where we were able to pet them and get up close, the fluffy alpacas are still our favourites!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on Arequipa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used our four days in Arequipa mainly to chill out and mill around the city, something we hadn’t done for what felt like weeks! We loved the beautiful architecture in the city and at times it felt like we were in the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lake Titicaca, Bolivia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Local communities believe that the shape of the lake depicts that of a puma hunting the rabbit.

Thus the name, Titicaca, comes from the word “Titi Khar’ka” meaning Rock of the Puma in Aymara (a local indigenous language).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Isla Del Sol&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked this excursion for convenience with Bolivia Hop so that we could leave Copacabana the same day. The boat picked us up at 13:00 and after an hour or so we were dropped off an a remote pier on Isla Del Sol. We were told the hike was around an hour to Yumani pier, where the boat would pick us back up. The driver offered no explanation or history of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we climbed up the steep steps, we first saw some Inca ruins. The Inca’s believed that the sun god was born on this island, hence the name Isla Del Sol, or island of the sun. There are no roads or vehicles on the island and 800 families live there. Their main income is farming, followed by fishing and tourism. We saw some women and children on our hike along the island, they had Llama’s and asked if we wanted to pay for photos. The best part of the island were the fantastic views of Lake Titicaca and other nearby islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Puno&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were initially going to do a day trip from Puno to Isla Uros and Taquile Island. However, after a day in Copacabana we didn’t get to Puno until 21:00 and the trips collected at 06:00. So, we decided to use Puno as an opportunity for some rest in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huaytusivepuno.com/&quot;&gt;Huaytusive Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, following a tough few days in Bolivia and we opted for a half day trip to Islas Flotantes De Los Uros.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a wander around Puno which is at 3,827 metres, but it is quite small and there wasn’t a lot to see. We were just about ready to stomach some beers again, so  we headed to a bar to watch the Liverpool vs Roma Champions League Semi Final, first leg. The game did not disappoint despite the best attempts of the staff at the bar, faffing with the televisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Islas Flotantes De Los Uros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a trip to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uru_people&quot;&gt;Islas Flotantes De Los Uros&lt;/a&gt; or the floating islands with our hotel as it was only S./25 (£5.60). It was very odd as we were rushed away by a woman into a taxi to the port. We were then handed over to a guy who walked us to the boat where everybody was waiting for us. The guide spoke in both English and Spanish but we couldn’t hear him very well due to the boat engine and his monotonous voice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived to one of the islands there was a little boy waiting for us with his football, so as soon as we jumped off the boat and onto the island we had a quick kick around while we waited for the group to congregate. We never thought that we’d play football in the middle of a lake on a bunch of reeds. It was at this point that we took note upon how fascinating the islands actually were and how the islands seemed to move with the water and our footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were introduced to an Uru family who lived on the small island and the young male explained that the islands were constructed by numerous layers of criss-crossed reeds that grow in the shallows of the lake. He then proceeded to show us where they slept before selling us a couple of Llama key rings and a balsa boat ride to Isla Capital. The young Uros man referred to his boat as a ‘Mercedez Benz’. The boat was also made out of reeds and was pushed along by a speed boat as the little boy with his football sang ‘Row row row your boat’.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Isla Captial had a shop and a restaurant, with some signs about where we couldn’t walk. The guide explained that every footstep causes the islands to sink a little bit which means that more reeds need to be placed and repairs made. It seemed that Uros people had a tough job of balancing tourism and the maintenance of the island itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bolivia Hop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We opted for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boliviahop.com/&quot;&gt;Bolivia Hop&lt;/a&gt; due to the convenience of having everything sorted with minimal effort, but with hindsight we wish we had just sorted it ourselves. The La Paz to Puno leg of the journey seemed OK and was efficient, including the crossing of the Tiquina Lake. However, the overnight journey from Puno to Arequipa was particularly uncomfortable. The bus was absolutely boiling, there was limited leg room and the jerky driving led to a terrible night sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Lake Titicaca&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a pleasant few days at Lake Titicaca and enjoyed our rest in the surroundings, particularly after coming out of the busy La Paz. The highlight was undoubtably the unusual Islas Flotantes De Los Uros.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Paz, Bolivia]]></title><description><![CDATA[“The chicken that we eat is chock-full of feminine hormones.

&lt;p&gt;“The chicken that we eat is chock-full of feminine hormones. So, when men eat these chickens, they deviate from themselves as men.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evo Morales, Bolivian President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transport and Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took an overnight bus from Uyuni to La Paz with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.transomar.com/es/&quot;&gt;Trans Omar&lt;/a&gt;. This was an awful company, once everyone was on and the bus was full they let locals on. As there were no seats left they were left standing and sitting on the stairs. The bus was supposed to stop once in Oruro but it stopped around 3-4 times. The doors didn’t close properly either so it was freezing cold! The only plus was that they had been flexible in allowing us to travel the next day and for some reason we’d been upgraded for free from a semi-cama to a cama, which was much more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus arrived in La Paz at 05:30 so we jumped in a taxi and headed to the hotel praying that we could check in as soon as we got there and continue sleeping. We were in luck &lt;a href=&quot;http://cruz-de-los-andes-hostel.lapazhotelsweb.com/en/&quot;&gt;Cruz de Los Andes&lt;/a&gt; was pretty empty so we were able to check in and pass out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El Mercado de las Brujas and La Hechiceria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a day less in La Paz, following the extended stay in Uyuni, we headed out for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redcapwalkingtours.com/en&quot;&gt;walking tour&lt;/a&gt;. We had already seen and been grossed out by, the llama foetuses hanging up outside the shops in El Mercado de las Brujas and La Hechiceria or the ‘Witches Market’ near our hostel. Our guide took us inside a shop run by a witch doctor or yatiri, to explain more about Bolivian beliefs and witchcraft.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide explained that people of the Andes believe that they must make a sacrifice to the goddess Pachamama (Mother Earth) when they build something, as the land is not theirs it belongs to Pachamama. They believe that bad things will happen if they keep taking from Pachamama without giving anything; these beliefs go back to the Incas. So for example, when Bolivians build a house they bury a Llama fetus in the foundations of the house as an offering to Pachamama. In return Pachamama will ensure that their house is strong and no one is hurt during construction. Our guide asked what we thought people might sacrifice if they were going to build a 30 story building as a Llama foetus would not be a big enough offering. One of the group jokingly said a person but it turns out he was correct! The guide explained that it isn’t known fact, more of a myth, but when big buildings in La Paz are demolished human remains are found in the foundations. He added that people will talk about this ‘myth’ but no one will admit to being part of it. He explained that a special shaman who is said to have been struck by lightening, therefore he has died and been reborn, will find a ‘forgotten man’ such as a homeless alcoholic. It is said that the shaman will then give the man 96% alcohol until he passes out and he is buried alive in the foundations of the building. The guide told us that they face the man down so that his soul cannot come up for revenge. So creepy!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He showed us some other things the local people believe. He told us how they make other types of offerings to Pachamama, using paper and sugar, and bury it for something they would like that year e.g. a car or good crops. He also talked about some of the potions that they use in Bolivia; a love potion which you blow on the neck of the person you fancy and a punishing potion which will make someone your ‘slave’, by adding three drops of the potion to their drink. Sounds a little like a date rape drug to us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;San Pedro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met the walking tour in Plaza San Pedro in the centre of the city. The guide pointed to a building metres away from us and told us that it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro_prison&quot;&gt;San Pedro prison&lt;/a&gt;. We were stunned that there was a prison right in the centre of the city and it really didn’t look like one - no barbed wire, no guard towers, nothing. We were told that there are only ten guards who patrol the outside of the building, there are none inside. Families live in the prison and the children can be seen in the morning coming out to go to their school, on the other side of the square. This seemed unbelieveable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide told us that the prison is infamously corrupt; prisoners have to rent their cells from $10 per month to $1000, they have to pay an entrance fee and the guards used to be bribed so that tourists could have a guided tour in the prison. However, he said since the release of the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Marching-Powder-Friendship-Americas-Strangest/dp/0312330340&quot;&gt;‘Marching Powder’&lt;/a&gt;, this has stopped. I really recommend reading this (since La Paz, I’ve downloaded it and can’t put it down). It’s about a British man, Thomas McFadden, and his experiences whilst he was imprisoned in San Pedro for four years for smuggling cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide explained that Bolivia is now the second top country for making cocaine, after Colombia and the purest cocaine in the world used to be made in San Pedro. We were told that the people inside used to get it out by wrapping it in dirty nappies and throwing it onto the street from the roof. We asked why people don’t escape if the conditions are so poor and with such low security. The guide explained that the prisoners have their families living there with them, they own and run businesses on the inside, and he explained that if people are caught escaping they are sent away to a maximum security prison. This works as a deterrent and people remain in San Pedro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cholitas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In La Paz, supermarkets appeared to be non-existant. Instead, fruit, meat, toiletries and anything else we could think of were sold in markets through the streets of the city. It was mainly women selling the produce and most wore big skirts and bowler hats. Our guide explained they are ‘Cholita’s’. The term comes from the word ‘Chola’ which actually means mixed-race or ‘civilised Indian’ and is regarded as a racist term. The word has been changed in South America adding ‘ita’ at the end to make it a more endearing and to be called Cholita as a badge of honour, as one is born Cholita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cholita’s wear big puffy skirts to make their hips looks bigger which is a sign of fertility. Their skirts come down to their ankles and the guide explained that this is to cover the sexiest part of the Cholitas body, her calves. He told us that their bowler hats came from the British men who were working on the railway in Bolivia in the 1900’s, they ordered some that were too small for the men so sold them to the women. He explained if it’s worn on the top the Cholita is taken, if it’s on the side then she is single.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cholita Wrestling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redcapwalkingtours.com/en/activity/78024/cholita-wrestling&quot;&gt;Cholita Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; takes place in La Paz on Thursday and Sunday. As we were there on a Sunday we thought we’d give it go as it was only $13USD (£9) including transport, snacks and a drink. It’s inspired by America’s WWE and Mexico’s Lucha Libre, so we knew it would be fake. We’d read that there was lots of spitting and throwing food, so we also knew it would be a little crass. There were five fights in total, the first was men, the next three were Cholitas and finally another male fight. The storylines were obvious good guy vs. bad guy, but what took us by surprise was that one of the male referees got involved as a bad guy. At times it was uncomfortable to watch him kick and hit the Cholitas but the Cholitas were fearless and faught back. In the end he ran out of the hall with people throwing things at him and calling him all sorts of names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We read about the origins of Cholita Wrestling a little more afterwards and found that it was initially set up as a way for women in Bolivia who had been domestically abused, to let out their stresses and frustrations. Since 2011, the Cholita’s have a female run associations such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/100569187&quot;&gt;The Flying Cholitas&lt;/a&gt;, and write the wrestling themselves. Cholita Wrestling is a way for Bolivian women to prove their worth in a ‘man’s world’ and they feel it gives them equal footing to men. Wrestling also provides the female working-class a way to earn money from both tourists and local’s alike.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the locals took it really seriously, the kids were at the barriers trying to get signatures and they were throwing popcorn and food at the ‘bad guys’; shouting and jeering at them. During the last two fights the wrestlers came out of the ring and barriered part and were basically fighting between people. At the end we got a picture with the Cholitas and Dan brought a green shiny mask for £2.50. Cholita Wrestling turned out to be pretty entertaining, although possibly the most bizarre thing we’ve ever seen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolivia is a socialist country who absolutely hate America. Our guide told us that in 2003 their former President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada robbed the city bank and took off in a helicopter in amongst a crossfire. This was following protests surrounding an economic crisis and the ‘gas war’. He showed us the bullet holes in the buildings in the Plaza near the President’s House and told us Lozada now lives in exile in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their current president Evo Morales is now in his third term of Presidency of the country. We looked him up after the tour and he’s made some very strange comments. For example, he told the Bolivian people that Coca-Cola causes baldness and eating chicken causes homosexuality. He has also introduced a benefit for young parents which is encouraging young women to have babies; he introduced this following protests after he tried to ban the use of condoms in order to populate the country. Bolivia is a poor country and many of the people are illiterate and uneducated, the guide explained that this means people are easily manipulated. He told us that the government in the country use distraction techniques, so at one point the Bolivian Government decided they were going to make all the clocks backwards as the country is in the southern hemisphere. This led the people to protest about this and ignore the real problems in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d also heard a lot about Chile and Bolivia’s relationship in both countries. From the Chilean side, we found out that they won the War of the Pacific over 100 years ago and claimed the Antofagasta territory, land rich in minerals which used to belong to Peru and Bolivia. This meant Bolivia became a landlocked country and they lost their access to the ocean. People in Chile say that they offered Bolivia use of a port with no taxes but they don’t use it. The matter is now in an international court as Bolivia wish to negotiate and want their land and access to the sea back. Bolivia’s view is that this will help their economy and their country and Chilean’s don’t believe this will fix Bolivia’s problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El Alto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Alto is a neighbouring city to La Paz up on the hills. We’d heard about a big flea market there on a Sunday which sells everything we could think of; as its up on the hills, there is also great views of La Paz. We decided to go up in the red cable car as it only took ten minutes (after a 45 minute queue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market was insanely busy and anything that had been lost, stolen or broken in La Paz was being sold in El Alto market. You could buy remote controls, light fittings, car parts, odd shoes, teddies, the list goes on. We’d been warned not to stray too far away from the cable car station as tourists get mugged in El Alto but somewhere in the market we’d heard people could buy animals and be seen by a shaman. We didn’t venture round for long as there wasn’t really anything there for us to buy but we enjoyed the view of the city on the way down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdict on La Paz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Paz was the strangest place we had visited so far. From San Pedro prison, the Cholita Wrestling and their unusual sacrificial beliefs. It was quite a grim and dirty place and we both got sick in our time here. In the end, we felt like Bolivia was out to get us and we were very excited for our next destination, Peru!!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Salar de Uyuni, the Salt Flats We were so undecided about whether or not to cross the salt flats for three days from San Pedro in Chile to…]]></description><link>https://ourbucketl.ist//salar-de-uyuni/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://ourbucketl.ist//salar-de-uyuni/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Salar de Uyuni, the Salt Flats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were so undecided about whether or not to cross the salt flats for three days from San Pedro in Chile to Uyuni in Bolivia. Before we left the UK we did a lot of research which included reading nightmare reviews about drunk drivers, broken jeeps, no seatbelts, bad food and people generally having a horrible time. This was of course in between people saying they’d had a blast. When we arrived in Chile we contemplated not doing it and looked into getting a bus from San Pedro to Uyuni and then doing a day tour to Salar de Uyuni. But this meant missing much of the Bolivian countryside; in particular Laguna Colorada and the pink flamingos. We spoke to friends who had travelled to South America and each had had very different experiences on their three day tours of the salt flats but both told us we had to do it. After a lot more research we booked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldwhitetravel.com/&quot;&gt;White World Travel&lt;/a&gt;; they seemed to have the best most recent reviews on Tripadvisor. We paid £138 each all inclusive; a lot of money to gamble for a good driver and a good jeep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day one&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crossing the border&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were picked up by mini bus from our hostel at 7:40, even though we’d been told 7; not a great start. In around 45 minutes we’d arrived at the Chilean side of the border to be stamped out of the country. We saw the two volcanoes, Licancabur and Juriques up close whilst we were queuing. The Bolivian side of the border was a small shack surrounded by jeeps from all of the different tour companies in San Pedro. Everyone from World White Travel was split up into three jeeps as each one held six passengers and we were lucky to have a great group; a German couple, a girl from the US and an Italian guy. Our driver was called Hugo, he gave us breakfast, wrapped everyone’s backpacks up in tarpaulin and tied them to the roof of the jeep.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we were off, it was pretty evident everyone was a little nervous about what the next three days might entail. Hugo went to the effort of learning our names and told us to tell him if we had headaches from the altitude as he had a bag of coca leaves for us to chew on to relieve the symptoms. He was very attentive and gave a good explanation at each stop during the three day tour. This was in Spanish of course but the bits we didn’t get everyone else in the jeep was able to translate, as they could all speak 2-3 languages. After a short drive we arrived at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Avaroa_Andean_Fauna_National_Reserve&quot;&gt;Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve&lt;/a&gt; and paid out 150BOB (£15.50) entrance fee for the next three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Laguna Blanca and Laguna Verde&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo drove straight past Laguna Blanca, we’re not sure if this is because he didn’t like the lake, we were running late or it was to over take all the other jeeps but either way we headed straight to Laguna Verde. This was supposed to be a bright green lake but Hugo explained that this only happens depending on the wind distrubing the sediments in the water. It was at the base of the Licancabur volcano, so we managed to capture a decent photo of the lake with the volcano in the background before we made our way to the next stop.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dali Desert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way we saw a culpeo fox (or Andean fox), Hugo slowed down so we could get a photo through the windows of the jeep. Soon after we arrived at the Salvador Dali Desert. It’s named this because it looks like the landscapes in Salvador Dali’s paintings, despite the name he never went there. We stopped for a few photo’s and the landscape was very orange or burnt red. We didn’t stay long before driving off to the next stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sol de Mañana&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a geothermal field, the name means morning sun in Spanish. We were told to mind our step but allowed to walk between the bubbling pits of mud lakes and steam pools which were up to 150-200C. It smelt like sulphur and we were in a seismically active area so we hoped there wouldn’t be an earthquake as we were walking along the thin ridges between the boiling pools of mud! At this point we were 4,900m high; the highest we’d go. We’d started to get headaches from the altitude and our bags of crisps were filled with air and looked like they would pop! Sol de Mañana was beautiful and looked like it was from another world. This was one of our favourite landscapes during the three day tour.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thermal Pools in Polques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thermal pools were more of a photo opportunity for ^BOB (60p) than a relaxing soak in hot water. It was around 28C and we were told not to stay in the thermal pool for more than fifteen minutes due to the possibility of the altitude making us feel light headed when we got out. The water was warm and the sun was shining, but the sides of the pool were really slimey. Apparently the high content of minerals in the water can relieve the symptoms of arthritis and rheumatism but it seemed to us to be more of a tourist stop on the way to the salt flats. We stayed in for about ten minutes and it was relaxing to be in the hot water after weeks of temperamental showers and no baths in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Laguna Colorada&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some bangers and mash for lunch at the hostel, we headed to Laguna Colorada which was incredible! It was a massive lake that looks pink/red caused by red sediments and pigmentation of some of the algae in the lake. It also has white borax islands which contrast with the red of the water and the green grass, making the lake look multicoloured. There were hundreds of James Flamingos in the lake and we saw some grey baby ones! We had an hour to wander around the lake, which we did slowly due to being short of breath from the altitude.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we arrived at our first basic hostel; Huayllajara. It was a concrete room with six concrete platforms and a mattress on top. We were provided with loads of blankets and an extra sleeping bag. We’d been told that as we were sleeping at 4100m it could get really cold between -2 and -5 and of course there was no heating as we were in the middle of nowhere. We had some Mate and some time to chill, no one dared to use the shower as there was only cold water. After a three course meal, which was probably some of the best food we’d eaten since we’d been away; vegetable soup, spaghetti bolognese and fruit, we put on all of our layers and went to bed at 20:30 as we had to be up at 06:00 the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternative route&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly we were all really warm during the night and had to remove layers; we’re not sure if it had been milder, or if it was because there were six bodies in the room but none of us had really felt the cold. On the second day we were supposed to be visiting a stone tree, three lakes and a small salt flat before heading to the Salt Hostel for our second night. However after the jeep was loaded Hugo said that we could do the alternative route with one of the other jeeps. He said two jeeps had to go together and there would be less lakes, more rocks and lots of llamas. Everyone seemed keen to do the alternative route but Dan and I remained suspicious about the drivers motives for taking us on a path not offered by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route started off-road and we noticed how careful Hugo was when he was driving. He would follow the newer paths with less rocks and he drove slower than the other jeep that had come with us on the alternative route. It was very reassuring after all of the reviews we had read about dangerous driving!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Laguna Capina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was the entrance to Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve, where we had to show the tickets we purchased the day before. There were no toilets here so we had to make the most of mother nature. We then headed to Laguna Capina, this was a lake near some Borax mines. There were no flamingos here and the lake was a bit dried up. We also stopped at another lake not too much further along the road. There were more flamingos here but it was nothing in comparison to Laguna Colorada. We took a few pictures and then got back in the jeep and headed towards the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rock tree &amp;#x26; Lost city of Italy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo wasn’t lying when he said there was lots of rocks on this route. We first stopped at a rock tree, formed from volcanic lava. Then we stopped at a couple of rocks that looked like a face and a teapot. Finally we went to Italia Perdida, Hugo explained that the rocks here were found by an Italian guy on a motorbike who said they looked like his village in Italy, hence where its name comes from. We saw a small Inca house here and a hole in the rocks, a similar shape to Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped at Laguna Negra for lunch; rice, tuna and lots of salad. Hugo walked us firstly over some marsh land which had llamas grazing on it. They were decorated with colourful earrings and occasionally looked up to see what was going on. The lake was surrounded by rocks; we climbed up some to get a good view of Laguna Negra. The water in the lake was really dark so there were really good reflections in the water. Apart from the clicking of cameras the lake was really peaceful and we spent some time relaxing here, until a guy got out his drone. The buzzing was awful and ruined the ambience of the lake. We also saw a Vischacha which is a rabbit like creature belonging to the chinchilla family. They were scuttling along the rocks but were way to quick for me to snap on my camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Anaconda Canyon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again we were told to be careful as we clambered over rocks to a viewpoint of the canyon; basically a big rock hanging over the edge. It was a big drop and neither of us ventured too close to the edge! The canyon snaked around and Hugo had explained this is where it got it’s name from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Salt Flat Chiguana&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a small salt flat not far from our second hostel. It wasn’t as white as the Salar de Uyuni but it was a good place to practice some of our persepctive photos. It was here we realised that ‘drone guy’ was in the other jeep as it only took a few minutes before the peaceful countryside was being ruined by an inssessent buzzing again. There was a railway line crossing through the salt flats which used to transport minerals to Chile from Bolivia’s mines. The surroundings were beautiful with big volcanoes such as one called Ollague which we later learned is still active.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Salt Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second night was spent in a salt hostel. The bricks, tables and benches were made from salt and there was salt all over the floor; which was super impractical! We were able to have a hot shower here and had chicken and chips for dinner! Whilst Dan was showering, I went for a wander around the village along the dusty roads and found the remains of the jaw of a llama with its teeth intact just lying in the road. I watched the sun go down behind the hill and the moon come out before heading back for Mate. After dinner Hugo brought us a bottle of wine to share and told us we needed to be ready by 05:10 in the morning to catch the sunrise at the saltflats. Again we were in bed by 20:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Salar de Uyuni&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were up at 04:30 and ready to get the to highest and largest salt flats in the world. It took around an hour from the salt hostel, on the way Hugo explained that 50% of the worlds lithium comes from the Bolivian salt flats, which is used to make batteries. Hugo drove to the wet part which had a good mirror reflection once the sun came up! Later he and the other driver were trying to work out he best route through it, as it looked pretty deep. Some of the other jeeps had driven into it and we could see people standing on top of the jeeps to watch the sunrise. We were quite pleased that Hugo had remained on the dry ground as we would have had to have stood in the wet salt flat bare foot in knee deep water. Watching the sun come up was incredible and we got loads of great photos!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then drove to Incahuasi, meaning house of the inca’s, which is an island of cacti in the middle of the salt flats. It used to be at the top of a volcano. Hugo told us that the salt on the flats is 26m deep and that they formed from prehistoric lakes. We had a wander round the giant cacti before having breakfast. These were huge and Hugo had told us that some of them were around 900 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo then drove us to the dry part of the salt flats where there is no horizon line for ‘photo loco’. He was really good and took group photos for us using props - including with a dinosaur, pringles tub and coke cup. He then let us have some time taking our own pictures. One of the guys from the other jeep decided to strip off completely for his photo on the salt flats which was hilarious as the drone was out again trying to get a peep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Train cemetery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few more stops before we reached Uyuni. We stopped at the banderas, an island of flags; we managed to find the Union Jack! There was also a ‘Dakar Bolivia’ monument and a Salar and Llama Museum which we opted out of. The last stop was a Train Cemetery. Basically a load of rusty trains that we were able to climb in and over. It was founded in 1889 and built by the British; Uyuni used to be a bustling railway city connecting Bolivia’s mines to the rest of the Pacific. However, the mines dried up and the trains stopped running; rather than sell the trains for scrap they left them to rot. We had some time to climb over them and take photo’s which was probably a little dangerous but it made for a great photo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Bolivia’s version of Chorillana for lunch we emptied the jeep and said goodbye to Hugo. We were due to get a night bus to La Paz at 20:00 however just as we got to Uyuni, Dan was violently sick so we decided to stay the night. We had little choice looking for a last minute deal for a private room and bathroom but went with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g317033-d8309662-Reviews-Hostal_Castillo_de_Lilianna-Uyuni_Potosi_Department.html&quot;&gt;Hostel Castillo de Liliana&lt;/a&gt;. The decor in the hostel was like it had come from the 1970’s and the room was really dingy. The kitchen was filthy and it was freezing cold. We couldn’t wait to leave and compared to the rest of Bolivia, Uyuni was really pricey! After a night and day nursing Dan back to good health we hit the road and caught our overnight bus to La Paz a day later than planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our verdict on the Salar de Uyuni&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reviews of the tours for Salar de Uyuni are very mixed and there are hundreds of companies to choose from. Each one has good and bad jeeps and good and bad drivers so really it’s pot luck. We got really lucky with White World Travel and our driver, Hugo. We ended up having the most amazing three days driving through the Bolivian countryside which was definitely the highlight of our trip so far!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[San Pedro de Atacama, Chile]]></title><description><![CDATA[“What makes the desert beautiful is that somewhere it hides a well.” Antoine de Saint-Exupery.

&lt;p&gt;“What makes the desert beautiful is that somewhere it hides a well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antoine de Saint-Exupery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walking Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long lie in on our first day in San Pedro de Atacama, as we do, we decided to go on a walking tour! San Pedro de Atacama is a small town built around an oasis in the desert so we weren’t really sure what there would be to see. We went with &lt;a href=&quot;https://tours4tips.com/san-pedro-de-atacama/&quot;&gt;Tours4Tips&lt;/a&gt; and the only building we saw was a clay church. But it wasn’t the sites, it was the stories that made the walking tour interesting. Our favourite story was about the belief of the afterlife of the Likan-antai people, the indigenous people to the Atacama desert. The guide told us that the Likan-antai people used to put their dead in big ceramic pots with their animals, usually their dogs, and position them facing the sky. The story was told that the animal would take the soul of the dead to the Moon. They believed that the Moon was female, due to links with the Moon’s cycle. Then in three months time a new star would be born so that their loved ones could watch over them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great story from the Likan-antai people was about the volcanoes that can be seen from the town on the border of Bolivia. The two volcanoes are called Licancabur and Juriques. The story goes that Licancabur was in love with a mountain called Mount Quimal. She loved him back as he was big and strong. However, Licancabur’s brother Juriques was jealous and persisted for Mount Quimals love. When Licancabur found out he became very angry, exploded and decapitated his brother. Licancabur and Jurique’s father found out and moved Mount Quimal away from them, he made the two brothers live side by side for the rest of eternity. The guide told us that one day a year at sunrise and sunset, Licancabur and Quimal’s shadows are long enough to reach one another and for this day only they are able to share their love once more. He also added that on this day people in San Pedro celebrate love, which often results in more babies being born 9 months after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Astronomy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deliberated over paying for an astronomy tour as we thought we’d probably see some decent starry nights on our two night tour of the Salt Flats from San Pedro de Atacama to Uyuni in Bolivia. There was also a huge variation in price and in reviews. In the end we went with cheap and cheerful and we weren’t disappointed. We were driven to what looked like someone’s backyard outside of the town so there was no light pollution. We were also lucky as it was a new Moon so the sky was really dark and the stars were bright. The guide, Alex, showed us a video and explained about nebulas and supernovas; this all went over our heads. He got out his telescopes and showed us Jupiter, Belleguese, Sirius, the butterfly nebula and some other stars and constellations in the sky. He explained that the stars that twinkle the most are the ones that are closest to the horizon because the light has further to travel over the earth’s atmosphere. As we were having our picture taken, we were also lucky enough to see a ‘shooting star’ or meteor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Valle de la Luna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had seen some of Valle de la Luna on the way to San Pedro from the airport and it didn’t seem too far away, so rather than pay for a tour we decided to explore for ourselves. Clearly we’d forgotten the trauma we experienced in Bariloche. We rented bikes from the town, which came with helmets, puncture repair kits, lights and a pump. We told the guy that we wanted to do Valle de la Luna and Valle de la Muerte. He told us that this would take around eight hours; five hours at Valle de la Luna and three at Valle de la Muerte. We thought he was exaggerating to get us to pay for the full day of the bikes, which we planned to do anyway so we could take our time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We were expecting a few rocks that looked a bit like the Moon to be just off the road, but of course this wasn’t the case. We had approximately an 6km bike ride out of town to the entrance of Valle de la Luna. Once we got there and paid our entrance fee pf $2500CLP (£2.80) we realised what we had let ourselves in for. It was 5km to the actual entrance and there was loads to see there, caves, canyons, dunes, rocks and a mine. In the end we did a 34km bike ride from San Pedro all around Valle de la Luna, plus the short hikes to see the sites.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the entrance to Valle de la Luna the road turned to gravel which made the ride really bumpy, it also became hilly. So much so that we had to push the bikes to the top rather than ride them. It didn’t help that the gears were terrible too, however, it was fun sitting on them and just holding onto the breaks going down. We decided to complete the trecherous bike ride to the end of the road and then on our way back enjoy the sites.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscape was out of this world, parts of it looked just like a film set for a film about landing on the Moon or Mars. The caves were really dark and low but wide, we had to make sure we stepped over the dogs who were chilling in the shade there. We climbed a few miradors for the views but it was really hot with no shade. We noticed the air was really dry and it gave us sore throats; before we made it back we’d also got through 4 litres of water! We managed to bike and look round Valle de la Luna in six hours, by which time we were in no state to go to Valle de la Muerte, so had to give it a miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Hostal-Casa-Greda-1572027869532954/&quot;&gt;Hostal Casa Greda&lt;/a&gt; and it was the best hostel we had been in so far. Considering how dusty the roads were it was immaculately clean. The family who run the hostel pottered around making sure we had everything we needed and in the morning left us not only breakfast, but a sandwich and snacks for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on San Pedro de Atacama&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We originally just thought of San Pedro as a hub to get across the salt flats from Chile, however it was so much more than that and we wish we had stayed longer, as there were so many things we weren’t able to see or do. We loved this little clay town in the middle of the desert!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Santiago, Chile]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Laughter is the language of the soul.” Pablo Neruda.

&lt;p&gt;“Laughter is the language of the soul.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pablo Neruda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bus Journey &amp;#x26; Border Crossing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive from Mendoza to Santiago was the most picturesque journey we’d had so far, with stunning views of the Andes as we passed over and between the mountains. As were on the upper level of the bus we became quite nervous at the sheer drop as the bus snaked along the trails down the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the border crossing, we were puzzled to see a Chile flag as all other bus journeys we had taken, stopped at the border control of the country we were leaving to stamp our passports first. In Brazil, we had overheard some people saying that they had huge fines when trying to re-enter countries that they had left without getting a stamp. When we told the bus driver he shrugged it off and said we didn’t need a stamp and when we queried it with an older Brazilian man, he told us that Argentina doesn’t care! If we ever come back to Argentina, hopefully they won’t care then either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having thrown on our big and small backpacks once we arrived in Santiago, looking like turtles, we navigated ourselves onto a main road. We were immediately met with the hustle and bustle of the busy streets as vendors shouted desperately trying to get anyone to buy their fake nike trainers or dog coats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After squeezing onto the metro, around 45 minutes later we arrived at the stop closest to the hostel. Due to the hustle and bustle earlier, we were relieved to walk through a peaceful and clean suburbian area and arrive at our hostel, Parron de Colores, just off a street called Coventry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earthquake&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning following our arrival, Sophie was woken by the room shaking and clattering of the windows. She in turn woke me up; apparently there was an earthquake. We later found out that it had a magnitude of 6.6 and its epicentre was in a nearby city. Our walking tour guide told us that anything above a 7 occuring within Santiago would have the capability to cause damage, so we were glad it wasn’t any closer. All it really did was open the window a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Museum of Memory and Human Rights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide from the walking tour recommended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-memory-and-human-rights&quot;&gt;Museum of Memory and Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the genocide from the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile from 1973 to 1990. Although the museum was free, we were told at the entrance that it was all in Spanish but we could pay for an English audio guide, which we opted against. Fortunately, we found that the numerous videos were subtitled in English and there were some translated displays dotted around so we were able to get a good understanding of each area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military dictatorship in Chile was something we both knew very little about and we were glad we took some time to learn about this period in recent history. The museum was informative, moving and shocking across the diplays. There was a particular section that still haunts us, which was about the ways in which the soldiers tortured and interrogated the accused political prisoners. There was even a ‘how to’ guide with diagrams showing how to perform various different torture methods which would have been distributed to the soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d recommend anybody to research about this period of history, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship_of_Chile_(1973%E2%80%9390)&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has a good overview of the events that occurred. When we learned about the involvement and support provided to the military from other countries, such as the USA and the UK, it certainly made us wonder about history repeating itself today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cerro San Cristobal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning we ventured up Cerro San Cristobal via the funicular for views of Santiago in front of the Andes. We climbed up some steps to find a statue of the Virgin Mary which overlooked the city. It wasn’t quite on the same level as Christ the Redeemer, but impressive nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were lucky as the pollution above the city wasn’t too bad so we got to see impressive views at the top and on the teleferico (cable car).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bellavista&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bellavista was definitely our favourite area of Santiago. There was loads of street art, hipster bars and restaurants where we spent an afternoon wandering and came back on an evening for food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walking tour guide explained that, as Santiago was growing, the rich aristocrats who had lived on the other side of the river pushed all of the risque places they didn’t want to taint their reputation over to Bellavista. That wasn’t to say that they didn’t visit! Pablo Neruda who was a famous Chilean poet and politician bought his mistress a house in Bellavista so that he could sneak off and meet her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drink&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the walking tour guide’s recommendation we tried a few drinks down student street, including Piscola (pisco and Coca-Cola) and Terramoto. Terramoto is translated to mean earthquake because it’s said that if you have a few of them, afterwards when you stand up you feel as though the ground is shaking. I only had one so I wasn’t about to experience our second earthquake in Santiago. There are a few variations of Terramoto, but the one I had was made up of a fortified white wine (like Country Manor), pineapple ice cream and a bitter spirit called fernet. Not the best sounding combination but if you’re a student, it’s strong, cheap and a good way to get drunk.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour guide explained that because the coffee was so awful in Chile, noone really drank it until a visionary entrepreneur set up a coffee shop, nicknamed coffee with legs. Customers would go for a really bad coffee served by strippers essentially! The majority of the coffee shops had blacked out windows but the tour guide showed us one that you could peep inside, which we did and it was a very bizarre scene. Young women stood on podeums with short red dresses on talking to and kissing the customers on the cheek goodbye. I starred it on Google Maps but we never went back. The guide told us that that his girlfriend once dragged him to ‘coffee with three legs’ which I don’t think needs any further explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free Walking Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can probably tell with all the mentions of the walking tour at &lt;a href=&quot;https://freetoursantiago.cl/portada.html&quot;&gt;Free Tour Santiago&lt;/a&gt;, we thought that the guide Franco was fantastic. Even though the tour lasted 4 hours, it really didn’t feel like that and we were disappointed that it had to end. We even bumped into the “Mayor” of Santiago as we passed his offices who welcomed us to the city. Although later googling showed the mayor to be a woman so maybe we misheard!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide also told us about the Mapuche people in Chile, that they are indiginous people to Chile and there are violent conflicts today going on about their rights. He also told us about Chilean Independence day; that it is the only day where people fight in the street and things can turn violent due to the political differences in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also finally found out what the figures were in Puerto Natales,the naked men that were patterned wearing a mask. The guide told us these are from the Selk’nam people who lived in Patagonia. One of their traditions was that when a boy became a man, the males in the family would paint themselves like this and then try to scare the boy, if he wasn’t frightened then he was a man. The guide recommended going to the Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino to learn more about this, but we ran out of time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Santiago&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both absolutely loved Santiago from the suburban regions, to the hustle and bustle of the city to the hipster, student neighbourhood. So much so, that it was the first place we visited where we could easily see ourselves living. Everyone we spoke to was warm and friendly which was a refreshing change to some of the Argentinean’s we encountered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Valparaiso, Chile]]></title><description><![CDATA[“We are not hippies, we are happies.” Art+Believe.

&lt;p&gt;“We are not hippies, we are happies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art+Believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Street Art&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We travelled to Valparaiso by bus from Santiago which only took a couple of hours. Considering how close the two cities are, they’re very different. Valparaiso is a port city which looks very run down; rubbish on the streets, cracked pavements and crumbling houses. It’s built on the hills so all the streets are disorganised and muddled and every building is a different shape and colour, and most have a mural or graffiti on them. There was so much surrounding us we didn’t know where to look! It took around five minutes for us to fall in love with Valparaiso and to understand why it has the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw absolutely loads of street art by artists such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://anis88.cl/&quot;&gt;Anis&lt;/a&gt;, Un Kolor Distinto, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/daniel.marceli/?hl=en&quot;&gt;Daniel Marceli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/cuelli.mangui/&quot;&gt;Pablo Cuellimangui&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freetourvalparaiso.cl/portada.html&quot;&gt;free walking tour&lt;/a&gt; our guide stopped and spoke to someone who he later told us was his friend, Pablo Cuellimangui. He was carrying his gear to make more art in the city. The guide told us that street art in Valparaiso is a vicious circle, as some of the artists protest against tourism in their art, yet tourists come to see their work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valparaiso was really overwhelming. Sometimes we walked down the same street in opposite directions and it looked completely different, because of the art or the buildings that we noticed. The guide said Valparaiso was full of secrets, that buildings would be shaped like boats, or the underside of steps painted, and that we had to be really paying attention to see all of its charm. It’s a wonder that I only trod in dog poo once with so much to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cerro Alegre &amp;#x26; Cerro Concepcion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explored these two touristic hills on the walking tour. Valparaiso is known for its ‘elevators’ up it’s hills and we rode the Queen Victoria elevator to the top. During the walking tour we met the 97 year old man who helped make the city a world heritage site and visited the oldest brewery in Valparaiso &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cerveceraaltamira.cl/&quot;&gt;Altamira&lt;/a&gt;, where beer was first introduced to the city. The guide also explained to us why Valparaiso is so poor and so different to its neighbouring city Santiago. He explained that Valparaiso was an important port city for the world when ships had to pass around the bottom of South America. But that it became a forgotten city after the Panama Canal was built, as this was a quicker and cheaper route between Europe and Australasia/Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the walking tour, we went with the guides recommendation to see the city from the sea and took a 30 minute boat ride for $3000CLP (£3.50). For the money it was worth it, the boat took us around the port area where we saw a couple of sealions on a buoy and one swimming. We also saw some of the navy ships, got a wave from the captain, saw a submarine and all of the shipping containers being moved in the port.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having researched Valparaiso before we got there, we had read numerous blogs about people being robbed in broad daylight in various parts of the city and that the hills were dangerous for a gringo backpacker to wander around alone. So we decided to splash out a little more for a hostel in the touristic area of Cerro Alegre, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.casaverdelimon.com/hostal_en.html&quot;&gt;Hostal Casa Verde Limon&lt;/a&gt;. It had really high ceilings and its staircases and hallways were muddled, like the rest of Valparaiso. And, just like Rio, our visit to Valparaiso was trouble free. We did end up wandering some of the hills on our own and we never felt threatened at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Doggy Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our walking tour we learned that Chile has one million street dogs and 12,000 of them live in Valparaiso. At the beginning of the tour a chubby golden labrador joined us. The guide told us her name is ‘Pork Chop’ or in the hills they call her ‘Shakira’ because of the way her bum moves as she walks up the hills. She followed us for most of the tour. We’d noticed that some of the dogs barked at people as they walked past but we had remained unscatched, and dogs would just happily follow us around before they found someone more interesting. The guide told us that the dogs in Valparaiso are racist; he explained that they love tourists and only bark at the local people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Empanadas &amp;#x26; Chorrillana&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The empanadas in Argentina had been good but they had absolutely nothing on the empanadas we ate in Chile. We’d read about a place called Le Pato, who do really great baked empanadas. On our first evening in Valpraiso whilst we were exploring the hills, we went on a mission to find Le Pato. It was worth it; Dan had a blood sausage one and I had a veggie and lentil one. They were big and absolutely stuffed full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also went to Delicious Express, the best place for fried empanadas with 80 different types of fillings. We went twice, they were that good! We tried chicken, cheese and pepper and bacon, meat, cheese and onion. The great thing about Delicious Express was that the empanada’s were cooked fresh and were piping hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chorrillana; a traditional Chilean dish. We had been told about this dish on the walking tours in both Santiago and Valparaiso. The one we had at El Pimenton was a layer of apple sauce, a huge layer of fries, covered in beef and onions with three fried eggs on top. Heart attack on a plate. It cost $13500CLP for a double dish for two, which is around £15, possibly the most expensive chips we’ve ever eaten!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Valparaiso&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to cut our time short in Santiago to make some room to visit Valparaiso and we’re so glad we did. It was just our kind of place; chaotic, muddled, gritty and covered in graffiti!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mendoza, Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[“My only regret in life is that I did not drink more wine.” Ernest Hemingway.

&lt;p&gt;“My only regret in life is that I did not drink more wine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernest Hemingway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Chocolate to Wine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our journey from Bariloche to Mendoza was a hardcore twenty hour bus ride. We did some research before we booked; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andesmar.com/en/&quot;&gt;Andesmar&lt;/a&gt; had good reviews so we went with them and booked a cama (bed) for £80. The bus left Bariloche at 13:00 and we arrived in Mendoza the following morning at 08:30. The first interaction we had from a staff member on the bus was around 20:00 when they launched into a very loud game of bingo. At this point we were really thirsty, but at least we could work on our numbers in Spanish. We were finally offered dinner and a drink at 22:30, just 9.5 hours into the journey. If this was a good company we wondered what the others were like!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vino Tinto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason people go to Mendoza is of course for the wine, in particular Argentinan Malbec. As we had been so unsuccessful at navigating around Bariloche ourselves, we decided to book a tour to explore Maipu Valley. We went with a full day biking tour booked through our hostel, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hostel-mora-mendoza.mendoza-hotels-ar.com/en/&quot;&gt;Mora International Hostel&lt;/a&gt; for £30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour itself was a little unbelievable at times; they were over an hour late for pick up, abandoned us for an hour and a half at the first bodega and all the guide really said was ‘vamos!‘. The bikes were another thing altogether. We use the word ‘bikes’ loosely as they had no gears, no breaks and we weren’t given a helmets. They were basically some metal poles welded together with two wheels and the hardest seat in the world to sit on. We had to hobble around with bruised bumcheeks for days after our bumpy bikeride around Maipu. We also thought we’d be biking around the vineyards, but in actual fact we biked the main roads between the vineyards, not so idyllic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the tours in the bodega’s were really interesting; we now know how to taste wine properly, how to tell if its been in an oak barrel and for how long! Proper wine snobbery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first bodega we visited was Bodegas y Vinedos Familia Cecchin Organicos. They explained that they use trees and herbs to distract the insects from eating the grapes rather than chemicals. We tasted three different types of wine, all were delicious. Whilst we were waiting for the guide and driver to return, one of the men working at the vineyard gave us all some Malbec grapes to try before the lorry tipped them in the squisher. The second bodega was Vistandes, here we learned the difference between a young wine, reserve and gran reserve and tasted two more wines.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We biked to the Beer Garden for a pint and empanada for lunch and got talking to a Swiss couple who were finding the tour as amusing as we were. We tried to order a glass of red but despite being in the wine capital of Argentina, surrounded by vineyards, they didn’t have any. After lunch, we made our way to the last Bodega, Dominica. A tour wasn’t offered around the vineyards here, but the guide did teach us how to taste the wine properly and we brought a bottle to enjoy that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mendoza City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a walking tour of the city and the guide told us lots of things we’d have never known otherwise; that the paths and roads are so wide in case of an earthquake and that there are no trees native to Mendoza, they’re all imported from elsewhere. He took us to the main spots in the city, which weren’t really grand at all. After spending so long in cities in Patagonia, which are made for tourists visiting the national parks, it was refreshing to be back in a true Latin American city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a Sunday in Mendoza, and like all other cities we had been to, everything was closed, so we had a picnic in San Martin Park and sunbathed all afternoon. We also headed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.premiumtowersuites.com/mendoza/&quot;&gt;Premium Tower Suites Hotel&lt;/a&gt; to have a coffee in their restuarant on the top floor to enjoy the view. However it was closed to the public due to a private function. We did get a glimpse of Mendoza surrounded by the Andes but not for long enough to get a picture before we were shooed away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our last night in Argentina we went for steak in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laluciagrillbar.com.ar/&quot;&gt;La Lucia Bar &amp;#x26; Grill&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t as good as other’s we’d had but it was our last chance for an Argentinan bottle of red and steak. We then headed to Aristides Av., the nightlife hotspot for the university city of Mendoza. We had some beers in Beerlin and Hangar 52, more microbreweries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Mendoza&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason we had added Mendoza to our itinery was for its wine and it did not disappoint. The city itself was a pleasant surprise, it was a slow paced, full of plaza’s and parks and it felt more like Latin America than the last few places we had been to. A great end to our time in Argentina!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[“All you need is love.

&lt;p&gt;“All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn’t hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles M. Schulz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chocolate City&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our research Bariloche was a strong contender to be one of our favourite cities in Argentina. It looked really picturesque, nicknamed the Lake District of South America with Swiss influences in its architecture and it has lots and lots of chocolate shops. We also caught the last day of the annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.welcomeargentina.com/bariloche/fiesta-popular-chocolate-bariloche.html&quot;&gt;‘Fiesta del Chocolate’&lt;/a&gt;; Bariloche had been decorated with colourful bunnies and eggs and children were queuing to meet the Easter Bunny in a grotto. It was like Easter met Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went in a number of shops hoping to pick up some cheap Easter eggs, but it seemed that Bariloche sell them all year round, so no such luck. Some of them cost around £20 and had an actual teddy bear inside. In the end we settled on treating ourselves with a tiny bar of Cadbury’s we’d found in a kiosk. However it definitely hadn’t come from Bournville as it had a bitter Hershey-like taste. It was very disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exploring Bariloche, we spent our last day doing what we do best, drinking and eating. We went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mamuschka.com/&quot;&gt;Mamuschka&lt;/a&gt;, a chocolate confiteria and finally caved and bought a couple of tiny chocolate bunnies to celebrate Easter. We also had the thickest and chocolatiest hot chocolates we’d ever drank, they were like melted chocolate in a mug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cerro Otto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://marcopoloinnbariloche.com/index.php/hostel-bariloche-english/&quot;&gt;Marcopolo Inn&lt;/a&gt;, which had possibly the most unhelpful staff we had yet come across on our trip. Asking for advice on what to do in the city and which buses go where, was like getting blood from a stone. On one of the receptionist’s bad advice on our first day we walked to Cerro Otto. He advised us to follow the road and suggesting it would take around an hour and 40 minutes. Not once did he mention a cable car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road up was dusty gravel and it was really steep. We didn’t see any tourists walking it and a number of intimidating dogs locked in gardens barked at us, making us jump as we walked past. Around a quarter of the way up, two dogs came out of the driveway of a house, barking, snarling and snapping at my ankles. I retreated quickly to the other side of the road and Dan said he had been ready to boot the one if it had bitten me. Thankfully as we walked off, the two dogs went back to their home and didn’t follow us. The dogs here were very different to those in El Calafate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight kilometres and two hours later we reached the top. The views were amazing of Nahuel Huapi National Park and Llao Llao, but by this time we were too pissed off to enjoy them. Dan had two huge blisters on the backs of both of his heels and my camera lens had stopped focusing so I couldn’t take any photos. We were also told by a tourist information centre at the top that the only way to access the restaurant was to buy a ticket for the cable car. The fee was $300ARS per person (£12). This cost included the cable car going both up and down and a return journey on the bus to the city. We weren’t able to buy a ticket one way and we were really annoyed that the hostel hadn’t just told us to pay the £12 and enjoy the ride up and down and just do some of the smaller trails at the top to enjoy the views. By this time, we’d run out of water, were desperate for a drink and there was no way Dan’s blisters were going to allow him to walk two hours back down. So we had no choice other than to pay the £12 to ride the cable car and get us off the tourist trap hill.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once back in the city, Dan changed into his flip flops and we desperately trawled around looking for a camera shop. As my Spanglish was not good enough to talk about a camera and the guy didn’t speak English we had a conversation over google translate and I reluctantly handed over my camera to him to have a go at fixing it. Two days later, he’d managed it. My hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Circuito Chico&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to avoid more national park fees so rather than get the boat to Nahuel Huapi National Park, we decided to instead explore the countryside on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barilocheturismo.gob.ar/en/short-circuit&quot;&gt;Circuito Chico&lt;/a&gt;. This is a road which loops around and there are lots of viewpoints of lakes and mountains and trails in the forest around it. Initially we were going to hire bikes and ride around it which takes 3-4 hours, but with big blisters from the walk the day before, we decided to go by public bus. We were told by the hostel it was easy to get public buses around Circuito Chico. We caught the 20 from town and it dropped us at Llao Llao where we had a look around San Eduardo Chapel. After this we started to walk towards the next viewpoint with the hope of jumping on a bus.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We kept walking along the road and it quickly became evident that there were no buses in this part of the circuit. In the end we walked 4.5 kilometres to the Tourist Information Centre in the hope that we could get some advice or pick up some bikes. However, as we turned the corner we saw it had closed down. We couldn’t believe it, the next stop, Bahia Lopez was 3km away and according to the information we had been given a different bus went from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Whilst walking the circuit we made sure we checked off the viewpoints so saw Lago Moreno and Lago Escondido. We saw some people biking but many of the trails said ‘no bikes’ so presumably all they could do was bike the road. It appeared the best way to get around was to hire a car and stop at each trail or viewpoint, then continue driving. As we reached Bahia Lopez it had started to rain and we hoped to find a bar at the beach. Wrong, it was closed and guess what, no buses in sight. Our options were either to keep walking, hitch hike or steal someones bikes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we weren’t yet desperate enough to hitchhike we kept walking, trying to enjoy the views along the way. It was quite misty which made the mountains and lakes look really eery. We stopped at Montanes Cemetery, a kilometre from the beach. It was really odd, up in the forest on a hill. We checked google maps to see how much further it was until there was possibly some civilisation and we found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cervezapatagonia.com.ar/&quot;&gt;Patagonia Brewery&lt;/a&gt; on the map. We had everything crossed that it was open, picked up the pace and continued to walk another 4km with the thought of a cold beer at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four hours of walking, 16km later, we made it to the brewery and had a cold overpriced wheat beer each. One of the members of staff told us that a bus goes past this part of the circuit every hour and the next one was coming at 17:00. We were really glad that we’d reached civilisation and had a way back to the city that wasn’t more walking or hitchhiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t help that we had visited in the autumn and not the summer, but it was clear that Bariloche was more for the Argentinian holiday-maker rather than the gringo back packer on a budget. Everyone had done the circuit by hiring a car and when we had explored the tours beforehand in the city, they were all in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steak and Breweries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of Bariloche’s redeeming qualities were the number of microbreweries in the city and the steak we had at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.altoelfuego.com.ar/&quot;&gt;Alto del Fuego&lt;/a&gt;. Dan managed to find a number of microbreweries including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BelekBariloche/&quot;&gt;Belek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bachmann.com.ar/&quot;&gt;Bachmann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cervezamanush.com.ar/&quot;&gt;Manush&lt;/a&gt;, each serving 5-10 different types of beer, ales and stouts and they were all willing to let us try samples before committing to a pint. They all had happy hour from 17:00-20:00 which was another bonus. An elderly gentleman from North Carolina struck up a conversation with us in Belek, he said he couldn’t resist talking to us when he heard we were English. He told us he had been in Argentina for around 5 weeks fishing in remote villages across the country and that he doesn’t speak Spanish. He was really well travelled and an interesting gentleman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alto del Fuego was a parilla or steakhouse. We went on our last night as Bariloche was our penultimate stop in Argentina and we were running out of opportunities to eat Argentinian steak. This was hands down the BEST steak we had ever eaten. We had beef de chorizo to share with chimchurri sauce and fries, washed down with a bottle of Malbec. The meat was so juicy it just melted in our mouths. The best part, the meal for two and wine only cost us £21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Bariloche&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning Bariloche didn’t live up to our high expectations. It was packed with Argentinian tourists enjoying their Easter weekend and didn’t seem to be made for the gringo backpacker. From the bad hostel advice we ended up walking 24km, got blisters and was almost bitten by dogs. However, with the help of its chocolate, steak and beer, it did manage to redeem itself.

&lt;p&gt;El Calafate is a small city in Argentina which seemed to be made for tourists. The main street ‘San Martin’, which is the name of all the main street’s in Argentina, was full of bars, restuarants, tour agencies and souvenir shops. Many of the shops looked like they belonged in a ski resort, made from glossy wood and filled with woolly jumpers. Again, there wasn’t much to do in the city unless we were prepared to pay £50-100 for day trips on boats and to the surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We tried to visit Laguna Nimez Reserve, a park full of local birds including Chilean Flamingos that was relatively cheap. It was walkable from the city, but when we got there it was both flooded and closed. We walked around the fence and we reached the edge of Lago Argentino, the biggest freshwater lake in Argentina. Many of the locals were fishing along the edge of the water but the wind was so cold we decided not to hang around. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.welcomeargentina.com/elcalafate/calafate-interpretation-center.html&quot;&gt;El Calafate Historical Interpretation Centre&lt;/a&gt; was on the way back, but at £6 to walk through a shed and see some dinosaur bones, we decided to save our pesos for happy hour later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dogs in El Calafate were different to any of the dogs we’d seen so far in South America. They roamed the streets, some with collars on and we struggled to work out if they were people’s pets or strays. After a bit of research we found out that they were strays but the local people look after them, feeding them, leaving water bowls on the streets and paying their vet bills. The dogs seemed to have territories, they were really playful and just wanted to be fussed. A cute Labrador had adopted our hostel, he just wanted to play fetch constantly with the sticks and pine cones he’d find in the streets. He saw us at the Historical Centre and walked us back to the hostel, he kept turning round to make sure we were following him, so we had no need for google maps!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food &amp;#x26; Wine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ate our first Empanadas in El Calafate, a stuffed pastry filled with meat. They were delicious and we were gutted we’d been missing out for so long. Being back in Argentina also meant better wine and Dan managed to find &lt;a href=&quot;http://cervezazorra.com/&quot;&gt;La Zorra Taproom&lt;/a&gt;, where he was content sampling the honey beers and stout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parque Nacional Los Glaciares&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Perito Moreno Glacier was the main reason that El Calafate was on our itinerary and why we had picked staying here over El Chalten, which was a little further north. The glacier is located in the Parque Nacional Los Glaciares which was around an hours drive away from the city. There was no public transport that went there so we had to suffer the $600ARS (£21) bus there and back. The bus dropped us around 10:30 and collected at 16:00, so we took our time walking around the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park was quite small in comparison to others we’d visited, with three trails offering different views of the glacier. The trails were on metal walkways which meant that they were really easy and didn’t take long at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we could even see the glacier, we heard it. As chunks of ice break off and hit the water, they make a thunderous noise which ecchos through the park. We could also hear the ice cracking and creaking in the glacier. The glacier itself was impressive. It moves 2 metres a day and is one of the only glaciers in the world advancing not retreating. After a few hours of watching the ice break off the glacier, with numb fingers and noses, we admitted defeat and went to the cafe to warm up with a crap coffee and wait for the bus back to the city.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bed bugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blahostel.com/&quot;&gt;Bla Hostel&lt;/a&gt; in an 8 bed dorm, which was again full of snorers. We struggled to recall a night in a dormatory where we had had a decent nights sleep without someone waking us up in the early hours with their snoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem one with the hostel was that there were two communal toilets for 50 guests, cleaned once a day. Often there was no toilet roll, soap and they were blocked. Second problem, lack of windows. The dorm we stayed in had a window that didn’t open and the heating on full blast - not sure why as it was around 12°C outside. It made the room really stuffy and gave me a sore throat. Third problem, bed bugs. After we had checked out we heard two Aussie guys, who were staying in a different dormitory, having a go at the receptionist as one of them was covered in bites. His mattress had bed bugs and the hostel had left the infested matress in the hallway! Being ridiculously paranoid we grabbed our bags and left spending the time waiting for our flight in a cafe rather than in the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were so paranoid that when we got to our next destination we checked through our bags and the seams of our clothes for hours with our torches to make sure we weren’t infested with bed bugs too. Luckily, we had a narrow escape, for now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on El Calafate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perito Moreno Glacier was absolutely stunning and made our time in the small city of El Calafate worthwhile. However, our stay was tinged with the paranoia of catching bed bugs which meant we were happy to be moving on.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Puerto Natales, Chile]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Travelling - it leaves you speechless and then turns you into a storyteller” Ibn Battuta.

&lt;p&gt;“Travelling - it leaves you speechless and then turns you into a storyteller”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Battuta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A change of scenery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next destination was our first stop in Chile, Puerto Natales. Initially we thought we would have to stay a night in Punta Arenas, but we were able to get two buses to complete our journey in one day. The bus left Ushuaia at 08:00 and dropped us in Punta Arenas at 18:30. Our second bus left at 21:00 and we finally got to our hostel in Puerto Natales at 00:30. One very long day! We crossed the border at San Sebastian, they were really strict about what we could take over the border so we had to eat our meat and cheese sandwiches, nuts and banana’s before crossing. Our driver reassured us that our stash of Yorkshire teabags which we had been rationing since we left the UK would be OK. However, the sniffer dog at the border was more interested in his tennis ball than making sure we weren’t smuggling anything in our bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way to Chile the landscapes changed dramatically; they seemed more desert like, like something out of a western film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ushuaia is on a large island, Tierra Del Fuego, so to get back to the mainland of South America we had a ferry crossing across the Strait of Magellan. We got off the coach on top deck, for some fresh air and we were glad we did as we saw two Commerson Dolphin’s jumping out of the water, they looked like mini Orca’s! Sadly, they didn’t hang around long enough for a photograph. Our stop in Punta Arenas gave us enough time to get some Chilean Pesos out of an ATM, a £5 charge this time, and to get some dinner before finishing off our journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The City of Puerto Natales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puerto Natales is a small city which most people use as a hub to get to and from their treks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://torresdelpaine.com/en/&quot;&gt;Torres Del Paine National Park&lt;/a&gt;. It was much more like the South America I remembered from my trip six years ago; less westernised – no McDonalds, Starbucks or branded shops and absolutely appalling slow internet! One of the first things we noticed about Chile, was how much friendlier people here were than in neighbouring Argentina; people smiled and said ‘hola’ as they walked past. It was also full of stray dogs but they seemed friendlier than those in Ushuaia and less diseased. We weren’t sure if they were people’s pets or actual strays. One of them even followed us back to the hostel from the supermarket probably in the hope that we’d share some of our cooked chicken.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hostalarkya.com/es-es&quot;&gt;Hostel Arkya&lt;/a&gt;, which was more of a guesthouse than a hostel. We weren’t allowed to use the oven in the kitchen, which meant we had to eat out every night, but on the plus side, this was the first place we’d stayed where we were allowed to bring alcohol into the hostel rather than buying it from them. This meant even cheaper bottles of wine, so we drank plenty. One evening we ate in a Mexican Restaurant, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cervezabaguales.cl/&quot;&gt;Cerveza Baguales&lt;/a&gt; which was also a brewery. Dan managed to demolish half a kilo of chips and three taco’s. They were pretty close to British ‘chippy-chips’ except a little thinner and no vinegar. We also ate at a nicer restaurant on our last evening, El Bote, Dan had Patagonian lamb and I had stewed Guanaco, not bad!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had three days in Puerto Natales, so aside from a day tour to the National Park, we used our time to relax and wander around the city. Tour companies offered lots of activities but at £60-£100 a day, they were well out of our budget. We stuck to the free things to do in Puerto Natales; there were some sculptures by the water’s edge and great views of the mountains on the other side of the water. On a rainy afternoon we paid a visit to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.welcomechile.com/puertonatales/municipal-historical-museum.html&quot;&gt;Municipal Historical Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which was really small but had a lot of information about the indigenous people in Chilean Patagonia. They only disappeared in the early 1900’s due to Europeans settling in the area bringing foreign disease with them. We were hoping that the museum would shed some light on the weird statues we had seen around the town, which were patterned and displayed male genitalia. It didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Torres Del Paine National Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torres Del Paine National Park was massive in comparison to Tierra Del Fuego, at least the bits where we could trek. There are a couple of circuits for trekking in Torres Del Paine, the O circuit and the W circuit. The O circuit takes 8 days and incorporates the W circuit within it, so W was shorter, 4-6 days depending on the weather. We didn’t feel fit enough or really have the time to do either of these treks so due to the park’s size, we opted for a full day tour. We went with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comapa.com/inicio&quot;&gt;Tourismo Comapa&lt;/a&gt;, which we picked randomly off the high street after realising all the companies charged the same amount. The tour cost $27,000 Chilean Pesos, which was around £32 and then we had to pay entrance fees which was the same again on top of this. Another very expensive day trip in Patagonia, but totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coach collected us at 07:30 in the morning and our first stop was the Miladon Caves. The Miladon is a prehistoric animal which looks like a giant sloth and its symbol is all over Puerto Natales. The cave has this name as its bones, fur and skin was found there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then headed to a viewpoint of Toro Lake; the bluest lake we’ve ever seen. After this we drove to the Grey Glacier. The roads were narrow and windy, and we read on the leaflet that road accidents are common in the park. Shortly after that we saw a car that had rolled over and off the road as there were scratches all over the top. None of the tourists really seemed that shook up and no one had been hurt. Our guide radioed for help as there is no phone signal in the park and we carried on to the Grey Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to cross a suspension bridge over a river to get to the view of the glacier on the black beach; this only allowed six people to cross at a time. We had a walk along the beach and ate our sandwiches looking out at the Grey Lake and Grey Glacier. Another great view for a picnic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tour then took us closer to ‘the horns’, the mountain ranges of Paine Grande Hill, Cuernos del Paine and Almirante Nueito Mount and we had a lot of photo opportunities on the way. We also saw a waterfall, but after Iguazu Falls it was a little underwhelming, even with a double rainbow. There was also a thunderous noise and saw some white ‘smoke’ on the mountain, which the guide told us was an avalanche. Dan ordered a beer at the lunch time restuarant stop, the barman told us that if we walked to the other side of the hotel and went up the hill there was good views of the lake and mountain. Only a handful of people from the tour were up there so it was peaceful looking out onto the lake. These were by far the best views of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife in Torres Del Paine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came out of the mountainous part of the park and the landscape changed from mountains back to a dry desert like wilderness. We saw a herd of Guanaco’s crossing and the guide told us if we were quiet and slow we could get off the bus to see them. They looked a bit like Llama’s and now I knew what was on all of the menu’s in town.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver also  slowed down so we could watch some Emu’s as we drove past and when we got off at the last stop for a view of a lake, we saw a load of Andean Condors and some more Cararaca’s – the guide said that there must have been a dead animal where they were all congregating. We also saw Chilean Flamingo’s chilling in some of the lakes but from a bit of a distance. The second half of the day felt like we were on a Chilean safari, overall, not bad for spotting wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Puerto Natales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really loved Torres Del Paine National Park, although we felt we cheated a little by doing a day tour and not one of the hardcore circuit treks. We had perfect weather so the park looked very picturesque. Puerto Natales was a quaint little city, which gave us some time to relax and catch up on some rest before heading back to Argentina for more beautiful views of Patagonia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ushuaia, Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[“No one will protect what they don’t care about; and no one will care about what they have never experienced.” David Attenborough.

&lt;p&gt;“No one will protect what they don’t care about; and no one will care about what they have never experienced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Attenborough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Flight Nightmare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to Dan’s love of penguins, going as far south as possible in Argentina was an absolute must. Before we left we booked a tour in Ushuaia where we could walk among wild Gentoo’s, Magellanic Penguin’s and sometimes King Penguins on an island off the coast of the Beagle Channel. Getting to Ushuaia was expensive; a coach from Buenos Aires would take days so our only realistic option was to fly so we booked a flight with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dwtltd.com/&quot;&gt;Dream World Travel&lt;/a&gt; for £126 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to the Aerolíneas Argentina check in desk at the airport, the guy told us there had been a problem with our payment and sent us to go to the ticket desk. At the ticket desk, they told us to hold on five minutes. He disappeared for around thirty minutes, leaving us to become very anxious as time was ticking and there wasn’t long left before the gate closed and we’d miss the flight. After what felt like a lifetime, the manager told us that the agency ‘Travel Junction’ (who turned out to be a vendor for Dream World Travel) hadn’t made the payment to the airline. He told us we could either ring them again ourselves and speak to them or buy new tickets; he reminded us we didn’t have long as the plane would be leaving soon. We had no SIM cards in our phones, the next flight to Ushuaia was on Monday, we had accommodation and trips booked and paid for and we had 45 minutes to pay, check in and board the flight. £375 each for a new ticket later, we ran through the airport to board the plane! Of course the flight was delayed as we were on Argentina time, so whilst we waited we wrote a strongly worded email to Dream World Travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The City of Ushuaia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ushuaia is a small city of 75,000 people and apart from having a Hard Rock Café, it doesn’t feel like a city. It has one main street, San Martin which is full of shops, bars, restaurants and tourist information centres. There hadn’t been many stray dogs in Buenos Aires but there were loads in Ushuaia. A lot of them were just laid on the streets, they looked full of disease so despite having our rabies injections we resisted the temptation to stroke them. On our last night in Ushuaia, we declined an invite to go to a salsa bar and we went to the famous irish bar Dublin Pub instead. It was packed and seemed that everyone in Ushuaia came here at night. We weren’t sure why as it was packed, expensive and served green beer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ushuaia reminded us of places like Reykjavik in Iceland and Tromso in Norway, which in the past we have quickly fallen in love with. We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://antarcticahostel.com/&quot;&gt;Antarctica Hostel&lt;/a&gt; which again had a hostel cat! Dan said this one was his favourite as he was noisy and one night let himself into a dorm and fell asleep on someone’s bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met a lot of people staying here, including a Danish guy and a woman from Florida, who had come back from Antarctica and we were both very envious of their experiences. They told us about their time kayaking with whales and seeing the penguins in Antarctica. However, they also told us that the boat, on its way there and back, had rocked for 4 days, to the point where almost everyone was sick and people were huddled in the corner with life jackets on, sure they were going to die. It also cost them around $8000. Going to Antarctica was definitely well out of our budget!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Glacier Martial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The receptionist at the hostel had recommended several things to do in Ushuaia, one of them was a hike to Glacier Martial. He told us that most people get a taxi up for around $200ARS (£7) and then walk back down. He said it was 1.5 hours each way. As it was free to see the glacier, on the first day we got a taxi up there. It then turned out that from that point it was a 1.5 hour hike up to see the glacier, all uphill. We set off with our tree branch walking sticks that were at the entrance and made our way slowly to the glacier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some stunning views of Ushuaia and the Beagle Channel on the way and the surroundings made us feel like we were in Lord of the Rings. Annoyingly the view of the glacier had been better further away than at the end of the hike but at least we had done it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tierra Del Fuego National Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few different ways to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/en/tierra-del-fuego-national-park/&quot;&gt;Tierra Del Fuego National Park&lt;/a&gt; and one of them that we’d looked into was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trendelfindelmundo.com.ar/en/tarifas.html&quot;&gt;The End of the World Train&lt;/a&gt;. This used to transport prisoner’s from Ushuaia’s prison to work in the park. However, getting the train would only allow us to see a small part of the park and it was $850ARS (£30) on top of getting there and the park entrance fees. We went with the hostel’s recommendation and booked a bus there and back for $500ARS (£17) and then planned to walk the trails on our own. Armed with a photocopied map we followed the yellow posts around the park. The first trail we did was the Costera Trail (8km long) through the forest next to Lapataia Bay, it took us three hours. Unlike Ilha Grande, there wasn’t much wildlife to look out for, although we did see a Chimango Caracara up pretty close. What struck us was how quiet and peaceful the national park was, there was no sounds of people, traffic, insects or even water. Just pure silence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second trail we did was to Roca Lake and was only a 3 kilometre round trip. It was a great view so we braved the cold and stopped for a picnic. After this we did lots of little trails making our way to Lapataia Bay to the bus stop. The buses back came at 15:00, 17:00 and 19:00 and after being dropped off around 09:00 and our legs feeling like they were going to fall off by 13:00, we were keen to get the first bus back to the city. After walking Paseo De La Isla and past Laguna Verde we made it to the end of the trail and to the bus stop just in time for the 15:00 bus. We were also rewarded with the sign marking the end of the Pan-American highway, spanning from Alaska to Ushuaia. Literally the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expected the national park to be busy with lots of tourists on the trails, however it seemed that more people did the day tours on the coaches. This dropped them at the main viewpoints of the park so these places were a little bit busier, but on the trails there was no one around. How we didn’t get lost with our inaccurate paper map, lack of any kind of directions or signs and no proper hiking gear we’ll never know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Penguin Rookery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was definitely the highlight of our trip so far. Our tour, booked through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.piratour.net/en/&quot;&gt;Piratour&lt;/a&gt; took us to an island called Isla Martillo, where a colony of Magellanic Penguin’s live during the summer months to have their chicks in their burrows. They’d had their chicks in December so they were now adults. We’d also come at a time where they were moulting and were skinny from being on land for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to walk between their burrows and were told we could get up to two metres close to them but no closer. The guide told us that any closer would stress them out as their eyes would not be able to focus on us. He told us that they are not afraid of humans as long as they can see us. The penguin’s were mostly in two’s, pruning each other and some were in their burrows. They were also a lot less smelly than we’d anticipated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time with these penguins, the guides took us round to the beach, where there was a colony of Gentoo Penguins. On the way we saw a vulture devouring a dead penguin by the sea. The guides told us that the Gentoo’s stay on the island all year long and we saw 4-5 come out of the sea onto the beach after catching some fish. One of them waddled all the way up the beach to join the rest of the colony.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent an hour on the island, as it’s all that’s allowed so that the penguins do not become stressed. Piratour seemed to be the only company that offered tours to Isla Martillo and they were really strict about what we were and weren’t allowed to do on the island, so it didn’t feel like a tourist trap and felt that they actually cared about the penguins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the penguins, we had a hot chocolate in a cute little teahouse and then were taken to Acatushun Museum for a guided tour. This was really random, a little hut in the middle of nowhere full of bones that scientists have found washed up in Tierra Del Fuego of whales, dolphins and birds. We were also shown the lab where volunteers live, work and clean the bones. It stunk of a mixture of decaying flesh and freshly made cookies. A really bizarre end to our tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Ushuaia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the opportunity to walk between the penguins in their natural habit was incredible, like a real life episode of Planet Earth. It will certainly be difficult to beat! Hiking for hours through Tierra Del Fuego was also an experience as it’s a beautiful part of the world to explore. Annoying, but definitely worth the extra £375 to get there.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Without the streets nor dusks of Buenos Aires a Tango cannot be written.” Jorge Luis Borges.

&lt;p&gt;“Without the streets nor dusks of Buenos Aires a Tango cannot be written.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jorge Luis Borges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transport &amp;#x26; Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to Buenos Aires we took a bus from Puerto Iguazu, which cost us £80 and took 19 hours in total; it left at 14:00 and arrived at 09:00 the following day. We paid for ‘executive’ seats which were more like first class seats on an airplane.  We were given three meals, mostly bread and crackers, there was a TV with films dubbed in Spanish and we were given a small bottle of red wine with our meal. Our first taste of Malbec in Argentina. During the night we drove for hours through thunderstorms, with the lightening lighting up the sky every few seconds, luckily we couldn’t hear the thunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://puertolimonhostel.com/en/&quot;&gt;Puerto Limon Hostel&lt;/a&gt; which is easily our favourite hostel of the trip so far. The staff were friendly and there was a hostel cat called Max who Dan took a liking to. After Alz left we stayed in a private room which had cable TV, so I was able to watch Disney films dubbed in Spanish and it had a bath, so Dan was happy. The wine in the hostel was also $75ARS, which is around £2.70 for a good bottle of Malbec, #winning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;San Telmo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buenos Aires is a massive city and the hostel was in the oldest barrio San Telmo, which was very picturesque. It had cobbled streets and bars with tables set out in the plaza’s and on the streets. On Sunday there was a huge market which spanned down more blocks than we could walk down, selling lots of local crafts. Dan managed to find a cheap leather belt for his now too big Levi’s and we both bought new football shirts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could hardly go to Argentina and not go out for steak and wine, so we did, twice. We ate in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parrillalabrigada.com.ar/&quot;&gt;La Brigada&lt;/a&gt;, a restaurant recommended by the hostel for the best steak in the area. There were so many cuts of beef we managed to try t-bone, lomo (sirloin), tail of lomo and beef of chorizo; all mouth wateringly delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the immigrants settling in Buenos Aires from 1857-1940, there is an obvious Italian influence throughout the city. This has also shaped the way Argentinians speak Spanish, as beer is birra not cerveza. So, we thought we ought to eat at one of the many pizza restaurants too. We’d been warned that people think that the Argentine pizza is too cheesy, I didn’t think this was possible, but it really was! Dan had also researched a place called &lt;a href=&quot;http://thechickenbros.com/&quot;&gt;Chicken Bros&lt;/a&gt; which sold all you can eat chicken wings on a Tuesday, so it was inevitable that we were going to end up eating there too. We ate around 70 chicken wings in total, pure gluttony!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;City Centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As day three of Lollapalooza was cancelled we decided not to waste our time in Buenos Aires and we did the first of three &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buenosairesfreewalks.com/&quot;&gt;free walking tours&lt;/a&gt;, excessive we know. Our guide Fernando told us about how Argentina became a country and stories of the first people to settle there. He talked to us about Eva Peron, the first lady of Argentina from 1946-1952 who the nation loved and who Madonna played in the film Evita. He also showed us the Italian and Parisian architectual influences in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Recoleta Cemetery was one of the more peaceful places in the city. It was nice to get away for a short while from all the people shouting “cambio, cambio, cambio” at us on the streets of Buenos Aires, asking for us to exchange our money for their probably fake Argentine Pesos at their dodgy rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;La Boca&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to see a Tango show whilst we were in Buenos Aires but they were pretty pricey and the cheaper ones offered a lesson thrown in which Dan point blank refused to participate in. We’d heard that there were Tango performers in the barrio La Boca on Caminito so we headed to this area on the local bus to do some exploring. The boys were happy with this too as it meant a museum and stadium tour of La Bombonera, Boca Juniors football ground. We did a walking tour of the area as we’d been warned about theft at gunpoint in La Boca and to be aware of our belongings. Maru, our guide, told us about the area’s history and how the immigrants that came to populate Argentina ended up there. She also told us about the birth of Tango and a guy in La Boca let us look inside his house where he had lived for 40 years. He told us that at one point he lived with 11 other families all sharing one bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very vibrant and colourful part of the city which made for some great photographs. Maru explained that the origin of this came from people using scraps of material from the port to build their houses, included scraps of paint, meaning that they ended up being bright and multicoloured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a look around &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stadiumguide.com/bombonera/&quot;&gt;La Bombonera&lt;/a&gt;, which didn’t take long as the ground was tiny! We’d learnt on the tour that the people in the houses around the stadium had gone back on their agreement to sell their properties, so they could only build half of the stadium which is why it is so small. After the tour we stopped for a beer and watched the Tango dancers for a tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Palermo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to Palermo on our last day for a graffiti walking tour. We’d heard that as a city Buenos Aires was tolerant of street art and often commissioned artists to paint their houses, a lot of which occurred in Palermo. As soon as we walked into Palermo we realised we’d found the ‘hipster’ neighbourhood, full of bars selling craft beers and vintage shops. We spent the afternoon photographing the art in this area of the city and drank a few South American honey beers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Buenos Aires&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buenos Aires is a huge city with different districts; each one with its own style and personality. Our personal favourite was Palermo, with its quirky bars, vintage shops and graffiti on every block. We also tasted the best steak we’d ever had in San Telmo accompanied with a delicious bottle of Malbec which was for once within our budget.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lollapalooza, Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[“You lot are the best crowd I’ve ever performed in front of.” Liam Gallagher, Lollapalooza 2018, Argentina.

&lt;p&gt;“You lot are the best crowd I’ve ever performed in front of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liam Gallagher, Lollapalooza 2018, Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lollapalooza Argentina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were lucky enough to get tickets to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lollapaloozaar.com/&quot;&gt;Lollapalooza&lt;/a&gt; before we left the UK. It was after that we did some more research and found out that due to the laws in Argentina, alcohol cannot be sold at events that children can attend, which meant a sober music festival. Whilst breaking the news gently to Alz, we asked him what the worst thing was that could happen at Lolla, his first answer was that it was vegan, then he realised that it was the unthinkable and there was no alcohol. We had some thoughts about burying some or buying scarves with bags hidden in them to sneak some in, but the festival seemed strict. We decided to just accept it, after all, it could have been worse and been vegan!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our thoughts were right, Lollapalooza turned out to be very strict; on the first day they searched our bags twice and confiscated my biro, paracetamol, antihistamine and bite cream. The security woman contemplated confiscating my inhaler too but went with her better judgement and let me keep it. Security even searched through Dan’s snotty tissue in case he was hiding anything in there. Standards must have slipped after we got in and as the day went on because by 18:00 a lot of people in the festival were getting high on their smuggled in cannabis. But all was OK because at least I couldn’t dish out my paracetamol and antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t help comparing Lollapalooza to Glastonbury, which will always remain our absolute favourite music festival. In comparison, Lollapalooza was small with four stages for music, it also had a cashless system where wristbands had to be topped up and this was the only way to buy anything there. It had overpriced burger vans and ridiculously priced water which we had no choice other than to buy as the festival did not allow us to bring in our own food and drink. We did manage to find probably the best food at the festival and after a 45-minute queue had Rocking Chips with ketchup, bacon and spring onion. We were also pleasantly surprised that Lolla did turn out to sell alcohol! Alz was feeling better at this point and he managed to sniff out the Corona Beer Garden, so after getting our ID checked three times we were allowed our two per-day allowance of Corona. Hoorah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lolla was held at San Isidro which was around 45 minutes out of the city; getting the two metros and a train there and back was an absolute nightmare. Imagine thousands of people trying to catch a train back to the city at the same time after the headliners, it was carnage. The first night took us three hours to get back to San Telmo after a very long queue outside the train station and being squeezed onto an overly packed train. The second night we left 10 minutes early, missing The Killer’s ‘Mr Brightside’, a blessing in disguise really and managed to get back at a decent time and with room to breathe on the train.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music wise, the line-up was awesome, in the first two days we saw Oh Wonder, Spoon,Royal Blood, Imagine Dragons, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metronomy, Liam Gallagher and The Killers. They all put on a great show and made attempts to speak to the crowd in Spanish. All aside from Liam Gallagher who is of course far too arrogant to even say ‘muchas gracias’. However, he did tell the crowd that we were the best he had ever performed in front of! Due to horrific thunderstorms, which may have been summoned by Imagine Dragons when they performed ‘Thunder’, the third day of the festival was cancelled by the government, and we missed out on Milky Chance, LCD Soundsystem, Pearl Jam, Galantis and Kygo. During the night after the second day the thunder was so loud it set off car alarms, and one of the guys in the hostel said that the lightening had burnt up half of one of the stages at Lolla. People had also posted pictures on Facebook of San Isidro flooded and looking even muddier than Glastonbury. Lolla announced that they cancelled the third day of the festival in the interest of people’s safety and promised to reimburse everyone a third of the cost of the festival. Money we happily spent on more steak and wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Lollapalooza Argentina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music at Lollapalooza was of course amazing, however the poor planning and organisation of the festival let it down a little. We also think we’ve been totally spoilt by Glastonbury which has everything perfected to a tee. No festival will ever match up to its greatness, we’ll be coming for you Glastonbury 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sao Paulo & Iguazu Falls, Brazil]]></title><description><![CDATA[“There is a hidden message in every waterfall.

&lt;p&gt;“There is a hidden message in every waterfall. It says, if you are flexible, falling will not hurt you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mehmet Murat Ildan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One night in São Paulo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used São Paulo to break up our journey as we made our way to Foz do Iguaçu from Paraty. We spent less than 24 hours there and ended up eating our dinner in a shopping mall. As soon as we stepped out of the Metro station and onto the huge boulevard, it became evident as to why São Paulo is known as the ‘financial capital’ of Brazil. There were huge glass skyscrapers on each side of the road, uniquely shaped buildings and three lanes of traffic on each side of the boulevards. However, there was still a sense of underlying poverty in the city. On our walk back from the mall we saw two young boys hitting an empty glass bottle of vodka against the curb until it smashed. They cheered and then jumped onto the doorway of a bus as it was driving off, until the driver opened the door and it shoved them off. They were wearing scruffy clothes and one of them couldn’t have been older than seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had an interesting encounter on the Metro when we arrived, as three young men approached us and asked if we liked Tango. They proceeded to play Tango music right in front of us on their guitars and bandoneón for a couple of stops. What surprised us was that most people on the carriage applauded when they had finished and tipped them. If we had been in England, most people would have looked at their phones and pretended they hadn’t heard anything. We did as the locals did and gave them some of our Brazilian real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehostelpaulista.com.br/pt-br&quot;&gt;Hostel Paulista&lt;/a&gt; goes on our list of one of the grimmest places we’ve stayed. The mattresses were covered in blue plastic, the pillows in a plastic bag and Alz wasn’t provided with a blanket. The bathrooms were another matter altogether, the door had come off the women’s toilet, there were no locks on the showers and there was no toilet paper anywhere in sight after around 10PM. Safe to say after one night, we were glad to leave and carry on with our journey to Foz do Iguaçu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foz do Iguaçu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got off the plane in Foz do Iguaçu, the warm air hit us as we were back in temperatures of around 34C, even the breeze was warm. We opted for a local bus to get us to the hostel as the town seemed small. Getting on the bus with two backpack’s on, one on our back and the other on our front was a nightmare, as the bus had a pointless turnstile in the middle of it, which we had to go through once we’d paid. The woman accepting money for tickets got so annoyed with me trying to get through, she took my backpack from me and threw it over the turnstiles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had booked to stay at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tetrishostel.com.br/&quot;&gt;Tetris Hostel&lt;/a&gt;, made of shipping containers stacked on top of each other. We were shown to our 12 bed dormitory which was sweltering hot. We immediately thought that staying in a metal containers in such high temperatures was a mistake. However, the hostel offered free Caipriniha’s from 8:00-8:30PM which made it much more bareable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iguazu Falls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on our bucket list and one of the seven natural wonders of the world, we had always expected &lt;a href=&quot;https://iguazufalls.com/national-park/&quot;&gt;Iguazu Falls&lt;/a&gt; to be spectacular. What we didn’t expect was how long the waterfalls went on for and how big the National Park was, particularly on the Argentinian side. It was so huge we had to ride trains to get around. There are between 150-300 waterfalls in the park depending on the season, leading up to the big one Garganta del Diablo or ‘Devils Throat’.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Brazilian side, the platform out to Garganta del Diablo allowed us to walk to the middle of the river and look through either side of the falls. It was really loud and so powerful, that even from such a distance we were sprayed with the mist caused by the force of the water as hit the rocks. On the Argentinian side, we walked a platform across the top and watched the water as it pummelled down the rocks. The mist was so thick you couldn’t see the rest of the falls or the platform out on the Brazilian side. However, because of the sunshine and the mist, there were some vibrant rainbows that helped to make the perfect photo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also walked the upper and lower trails on the Argentinian side of the falls, which other than seeing the top of Garganta del Diablo, was probably our favourite part of the park because of all of the wildlife we saw. The lower trail also took us very close to a waterfall which was so violent it soaked us with it’s spray and mist, and the water was so loud we had to shout at one another to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were butterflies everywhere in the park, landing on our arms, bags and on people’s heads. Some people held out bits of fruit to attract them and the butterflies would sit on their hands for ages enjoying the sweet fruits. There were also Coati, racoon-like scavengers and there were warnings everywhere about them attacking people for food and that they may have rabies. We saw one woman stupidly sat on a bench eating some biscuits and when a Coati tried to jump up her, she kicked it away. They were however, deceivingly cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there were more walks through the park on the Argentinian side, we saw a lot more wildlife there. There were lots and lots of spiders, some which had made their webs over our heads on the trails, we quickly ran under those. We also spotted a really colourful Toucan up in the tree’s; I managed to snap a photograph before it was scared off by guided tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One even came into the crowd of people on it’s two legs, and because everyone was so busy taking pictures of the monkey’s in the trees, no one even noticed. Dan got a pretty good photo of it waving to everyone looking very cheeky.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if the day hadn’t been exciting enough, on one of our train journeys a jeep went past and in the front was a short haired blonde woman, looking very cool eating her ice cream - she looked remarkably like Katy Perry. As it turned out, she was Katy Perry. We heard one of the staff members later telling people she had come today and her presence at Iguazu Falls had even made the local news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crossing the Border&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d heard some horror stories about our intial plan of local transport to cross the border, where buses hadn’t stopped for people to be stamped out of Brazil leading to hefty fines. We got chatting to a Canadian girl in the hostel and she easily convinced us to share a taxi with her and a couple from England to cross the border to the Argentinian side of the falls, which was hassle free and cheaper than the hostel’s day trip to the Argentinian side. The hostel arranged this for us, however when the taxi came, the driver refused to take us as 4 of us had luggage. As it was nonsensical to pay double for two taxi’s on our budgets we went our separate ways and headed for the local bus stop. In actual fact it was pretty straight forward crossing the border from Brazil to Argentina; one bus to the Brazilian border, one bus to the Argentinian border and then another to the bus terminal in Puerto Iguazú. After an hour and a half, we were finally in Argentina and had to rembember to switch from obrigada to gracias. De nada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First thoughts on Argentina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dumped our bags at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.porambahostel.com/&quot;&gt;Poramba Hostel&lt;/a&gt; and headed into town to get some cash out of the ATM so we could head to the falls. The ATM charged us $240ARS (£8.54) to withdraw cash which was a bit of a shock. Apparently standard in the whole of Argentina! The bus was also £5.35 to the falls instead of the 80p it had been the Brazilian side; it became evident very quickly that it would be harder to stick to our budget in Argentina! It had been so much easier in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict Iguazu Falls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we’d initially done our research, people had recommended to visit both sides of the falls and we would totally agree with this. The Brazilian side gives great views from the bottom, but the Argentinian side is huge with unexpected surprises such as Toucan’s, monkeys and if your lucky even a celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ilha Grande & Paraty, Brazil]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Is it normal to have sweaty ears?

&lt;p&gt;“Is it normal to have sweaty ears? I’ve never had a sweaty ear in my life… They’re not even doing anything and they’re hot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Pilkington on Brazilian weather, An Idiot Abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arriving on Ilha Grande&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four busy days in Rio de Janiero, we’d planned to spend some time relaxing on the beaches of Ilha Grande. We booked a door to door transfer with &lt;a href=&quot;http://easytransferbrazil.com/en/&quot;&gt;Easy Transfers&lt;/a&gt; from Rio to Ilha Grande, we were collected at 07:00 and taken straight to the island; it was around a 3 hour drive and 45 minutes on a slow boat. We sat on the top deck and enjoyed the sunshine and a few beers until we got there. As we approached the ‘Big Island’ we could see why people in Rio had raved about how beautiful it was. There was a small stretch of bars, restaurants and pousada’s, coves of beaches and a pier towered by green hills covering the rest of the island. Dan said that it looked like ‘that island’ from Moana; he meant Te Fiti. The island was supposed to be very secluded with no cars and no ATMS, however on one of our treks we saw a bus full of tourists on the jungle path driving to Dios Rios. Definitely no banks or ATM’s though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the town was so small it didn’t take us long to reach &lt;a href=&quot;http://biergartenhostel.blogspot.com.br/&quot;&gt;Biergarten Hostel&lt;/a&gt;, where we had booked in an 8 bed dormitory to stay. It had two hammocks just outside our room and an odd shaped bench in the kitchen which Alz kept stubbing his toes on.  There was also a buffet style kilo restaurant attached, where we paid for the weight of food on our plates. On our second night in the hostel, new people came into the dorm, including two of the guys who had been at Books Hostel in Rio. One of them was Norweigian and had spent a night in Rio chatting to Alz about politics and finance over Caipirinhas; we joked that Alz had pulled so found it hilarious when he, by coincidence, ended up in our dormitory in the hostel on Ilha Grande. The second guy was from Bristol and snored like a fog horn; he was so loud my Harry Potter audiobook couldn’t drown him out, but at least we got to catch up on some sleep snoozing on the beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common animal we saw on the island were dogs. Lots and lots of dogs. They were everywhere, pooing on the beach, begging for food at night and walking the jungle trails to other parts of the island. We even saw a dead one, decomposing and washed up on the beach by the tide. Dan was highly amused by one dog who had dug a hole in the sand, was sat in it and was wearing a green tie. Some of the dogs seemed to have owners but others were strays and it was upsetting to see them so skinny and begging for food. It also meant that there was poo on the paths and main beach in Vila do Abraão, so we ended up spending most of our time in the little cove beaches slightly out of town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our first night on the island we spotted a couple of Black Tufted-ear Marmoset’s in the Vila do Abraão on the electric wires, I managed to take one photo before they ran off and disappeared. As we had read that there were howler monkey’s on the island, we decided to do a bit of a walk through the jungle on the second day to see if we could see any. This wasn’t supposed to be for long as we wanted to chill out on the beach; we were also wearing sandals and had about half a bottle of water between us. As we reached the beginning of the trail, there was  a warning about mosquitos carrying yellow fever. We’d had our vaccinations but Alz hadn’t. He decided to come with anyway as the vaccination hadn’t been compulsory to visit Brazil and armed himself with insect repellent. We ended up walking along a trail to Dois Rios, which was on the opposite side of the island and at one point we became determined to do the 3-4 hour trek all the way there. However, after reaching a viewpoint we turned back as we were out of water and according to the map we were only about one third of the way there; the sun was out and it was midday so carrying on seemed like a stupid idea. The view was stunning of the bay and it was well worth the hour walk there and back. Sadly, we didn’t see any monkeys, just big ants, butterflies, a few types of birds and a great big spider.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we felt like we’d failed the trail the day before, the next day we decided to hike to Lopes Mendes rather than take the boat trip. This was a 3-hour trek and we were way more prepared, armed with snacks, lots of water, DEET and walking boots. We followed the signs from Vila do Abraão to Lopes Mendes and once we got off the beach and into the jungle we questioned what we’d let ourselves in for. The beginning of the trek was so steep; climbing up steps naturally made from tree roots and holes in the clay ground. We were all soaking in sweat within about 30 seconds and only saw one other person walking the trail who over took us, so it felt like we had the jungle to ourselves. The first part of the hike took us about 2 hours to the first beach, Enseada das Palmas. This was also pretty much deserted, and it was tempting to just stop there; however, we’d read that Lopes Mendes was one of the best beaches in Brazil. We had another 40-minute walk through the jungle to get to the next beach Praia do Pouso and from there we booked our speedboat water taxi back to Vila do Abraão for later in the afternoon. To reach Lopes Mendes we had another 20-minute walk through the jungle, this bit was busier with other visitors who had taken boats from Vila do Abraão to Praia do Pouso, as the boats did not go straight to Lopes Mendes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopes Mendes delivered as promised. The beach was huge and secluded, there were no restaurants or pousada’s there, just a couple of men with their carts selling drinks and snacks. The sand was white and so fine, as we walked along the beach it squeaked beneath our feet. The sea was crystal clear, warm and it was so shallow we could go out really far and the water was only up to our waists.  Even though we were knackered when we got to Lopes Mendes, we felt a sense of achievement. It was well worth the 3 hour trek across the island to get there but we were exceptionally grateful for the speedboat back to Vila do Abraão.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long day we ate at a restaurant called Steak n’ Beach and had a huge mixed grill for the three of us. It came on a sizziling hot plate and consisted of two pork chops, two steaks, two chicken breasts and four Brazilian sausages, accompanied with a bowl of rice, a mound of chips and some salsa. It cost us $145R which is around £32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paraty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days on Ilha Grande we left for Paraty on our Easy Transfer and it took around 4 hours to reach the town from the island. The weather was overcast and it rained for half of our time in Paraty. On our walking tour in Rio, the guide had said that we had come to Brazil at a time where the seasons were changing which meant that the weather was hot but with some rain in the afternoon. Because of the weather, there wasn’t a lot to do in Paraty. I also felt a little unwell and Alz developed a fever, headache, muscle ache and loss of appetite. He googled his symptoms and decided it was likely he had yellow fever. It turned out that in November 2017 an outbreak of yellow fever had started in the State of Rio de Janiero and State of Sao Paulo; worsening in January 2018. Specifically people had contracted the disease on Ilha Grande!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason the free walking tours had been cancelled in Paraty and we didn’t want to risk a boat trip or a bus ride to Trindade to spend the day on the beach as it kept raining on and off. Therefore, we milled around the old town which was very picturesque, with its colourful boats, buildings and cobbled streets. The people of Paraty also seemed to have a fondness for classic VW Beetles, which were colourful and matched the style of the town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was here that we finally saw more monkeys! We were having breakfast in our hostel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sambacanutahostel/&quot;&gt;Samba Canuta&lt;/a&gt; and the staff told us that there were monkeys in the tree’s, they tried to coax them down with banana’s but they were having none of it. They lingered around long enough for me to get some good pictures on my camera though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The hostel itself was very quiet and we were pretty much the only guests staying there, which made the communal areas very awkward as all the staff seemed to do all day was play guitar and sing the Portuguese version of the Eagle’s ‘Hotel California’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verdict on Ilha Grande &amp;#x26; Paraty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ilha Grande didn’t turn out to be such a relaxing destination after all as we did lots of hiking through the jungle across the island. We ended up with around 30 mosquito bites between us but totally worth it for the beautiful views and beaches. Following this, we enjoyed our chilled out time in Paraty; a beautiful colonial town with lots of character that wasn’t even the rain couldn’t spoil.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rio De Janeiro, Brazil]]></title><description><![CDATA[“I sorta think from a distance… Jesus, top of a hill, lookin’ like he’s about to bungee jump, you pass it, you go, ‘There he is.

&lt;p&gt;“I sorta think from a distance… Jesus, top of a hill, lookin’ like he’s about to bungee jump, you pass it, you go, ‘There he is. Great. What else are we doin’?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Pilkington, An Idiot Abroad (not bitter at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arriving in Rio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we left for Rio, we were told in many ways about how dangerous it is there. We did a bit of research the night before and read about the trouble following the Rio Olympics. The government arrested some people to make the favela’s safe and promised to make the them better. The Olympics came and went and the government didn’t follow through with any of their promises to improve things such as health and education, which resulted in the violence within the favelas escalating. It seemed from google maps that our hostel was also surrounded by favela’s and we then read that because of the trouble there, the military had taken over the city. Felipe running &lt;a href=&quot;http://bookshostel.com/&quot;&gt;Books Hostel&lt;/a&gt;, where we were staying had also warned us not to take money out at the airport due to credit cards being cloned. To make matters worse, when we arrived in Portugal for a stop over, the lady running the hostel told us about her daughter who had been to Carnival a few weeks ago. She had been staying in Leblon, an area close to the biggest favela in Rio, Rochina, she had heard gunshots in Leblon and saw lots of people running away from the area. She warned us to be careful. This made us question why we were starting our trip in Rio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a horrendous flight we arranged a transfer with the hostel as we arrived so late. The driver pulled up in a Fiat with absolutely blacked out windows and drove us through the streets of Rio, we managed to see Christ the Redeemer lit up on Corcovado mountain. No crimes were witnessed in our first hour of Rio, however at traffic lights we heard people chanting and I thought there was going to be a protest or some sort of gang violence around the corner, it turned out to be football fans chanting in a bar following a Flamengo goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we did in Rio was head to the beach. The guy at the hostel recommended Gloria Beach, which he said was walkable. We didn’t take any valuables with us whilst we were still sussing the city out. However, our visit was trouble free, the sand was white and we had a great view of Sugarloaf Mountain and of Christ, when he didn’t disappear behind the clouds. The people selling beer and drinks were very friendly and it seemed to be full of locals jogging or sunbathing. As it is so infamous, we then got an Uber to Copacabana beach, Dan and Alz warned me that I would prefer Gloria and they were right. Every thirty seconds someone was in our face trying to sell something, sunglasses, empanadas, bikinis, canga (sarongs), caipirinhas and weed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last day in Rio, we did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freewalkertours.com/&quot;&gt;free walking tour&lt;/a&gt; of the Copacabana and Ipanema area. Our guide told us about the World Cup and how everyone gathered in front of the big screens to watch the games on the beach. We went to the restaurant where “The Girl from Ipanema” was written and walked to Lagoa Rodrigues de Freitas, a big lake, to watch the sun go down. The guide gave us some Brazilian snacks to try including Biscoto Globo, a weird banana sweet and some Guarana, an energy drink that tastes like red bull. By this time, we felt much more comfortable and confident in Rio and walked around the most expensive part of town to find some food after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Christ The Redeemer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had seen Christ the Redeemer lit up at night and from Gloria beach, but what’s a trip to Rio without seeing the wonder of the world up close. Following some advice from a dutch girl on our free walking tour of Downtown and Lapa, we decided to do as she did and get an Uber up Corcovado Mountain to see him in all his glory. The driver spoke no english and on the way either stopped in front of a favela to ask for directions or tried to drive through it, we’re still not sure. Either way, luckily a guy wearing an official guide t-shirt turned him away or told him the right way to go. After getting to the top, we went to buy our ticket, only to be told that there was no visibility at all and the live camera on Christ was just pure white from the cloud. We waited for some time and the boys had more beers, but the cloud didn’t shift and in the end we had to give up and pay excessive amounts to get back down the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on ‘Christ watch’ for the rest of the time in Rio, trying to catch a glimpse of him in a clear sky,  meaning we might get the opportunity to go up again. However, during the last two days of our trip he was completely covered by cloud, except for around thirty seconds when we were watching the sunset on our last night, he peeped out just to rub our noses in the fact that we hadn’t been able to see him up close during our time in Rio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Art &amp;#x26; Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the full Rio experience we decided to do a couple of walking tours to learn about the history and culture of the city. On the tour of Downtown and Lapa we tried Coxinhas, breaded chicken balls with cheese inside (that tasted a bit like mac and cheese balls) and ended up at the bright tiled steps ‘Escadaria Selaron’, a gift from Jorge Selaron to the city which took him over 23 years to finish. They were really bright and vibrant and one of our favourite parts of the Rio, leading to the Santa Teresa neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a wander to Olympic Boulevard during a pretty loud thunderstorm, one strike of lightning was so close and so loud it made the lady crossing the road next to Alz grab his arm. At Olympic Boulevard we saw probably the best street art we’ve seen in any city we’ve been to so far. It was a huge mural by Eduardo Kobra completed for the Olympics; it was so colourful and vibrant and represented the five continents of the games. On the way we also visited the very ugly Cathedral which is inspired by a Mayan Pyramid, Dan repeatedly told us that “beauty comes from within”. It looked a bit like the old Birmingham Library before it was torn down.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a good view of the city, we decided instead of paying extortionate amounts for Sugarloaf and risking the cloud of Corcovado Mountain we walked up the very steep hill to Santa Teresa, the hipster ‘foodie’ area of Rio. On the way Alz got a bit cocky and jumped up a steep step, resulting in his shorts tearing along the crotch. We got a good panoramic view of the city from Parque Das Ruinas, except for Christ, who remained behind the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Rio seeming to be a city that never sleeps, where the fruit and vegetable stores are open until the early hours of the morning, we had heard that the city is very quiet on a Sunday, and what we heard wasn’t a lie. The only places open seemed to be McDonalds and Starbucks. As there wasn’t a lot to do, we went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://visit.rio/en/que_fazer/mam2/&quot;&gt;Modern Art Museum&lt;/a&gt;, Alz and Dan particularly enjoyed mocking Giacometti’s “Four Women on Base”. We then went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mhn.museus.gov.br/&quot;&gt;Museu Historico Nacional&lt;/a&gt; which was free on a Sunday; we pretty much had the museum to ourselves as it was so quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food &amp;#x26; Caipirinhas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hostel we stayed in sold £1 Caipirinhas, either lime or passionfruit and we definitely had our fill of these. They have possibly rocketed to one of our favourite cocktails. Something which took some time getting used to was that everyone shared 600ml bottles of beer, we got very strange looks when we tried to order one each so followed the Carioca trend and shared and drank from teeny tiny glasses. On Alz’s birthday we went to a local restaurant called Os Ximenes; we had two massive steaks, Brazilian sausage, scrambled egg in Farofa, a tasteless brazilian flour, rice and chips. It was delicious although covered in about three bulbs of diced garlic. Safe to say we stank the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Rio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from being hot, Rio really wasn’t what we had expected it to be, it was so much better. It was diverse, colourful, vibrant and full of life. We barely touched the surface in four days and as we didn’t get to see Christ the Redeemer up close, one day we’ll definitely go back.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
