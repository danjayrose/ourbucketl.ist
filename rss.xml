&lt;p&gt;“Travelling - it leaves you speechless and then turns you into a storyteller”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibn Battuta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crossing the border&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next destination was our first stop in Chile, Puerto Natales. Initially we thought we would have to stay a night in Punta Arenas, but we were able to get two buses to complete our journey in one day. The bus left Ushuaia at 08:00 and dropped us in Punta Arenas at 18:30. Our second bus left at 21:00 and we finally got to our hostel in Puerto Natales at 00:30. One very long day! We crossed the border at San Sebastian, they were really strict about what we could take over the border so we had to eat our meat and cheese sandwiches, nuts and banana’s before crossing. Luckily, our driver reassured us that our stash of Yorkshire teabags which we had bought from the UK and had been rationing would be OK. However, the sniffer dog at the border was more interested in his tennis ball than making sure we weren’t smuggling anything in our bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way to Chile the landscapes changed dramatically; they seemed more desert like, like something out of a western film.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ushuaia is on a large island, Tierra Del Fuego, so to get back to the mainland of South America we had a ferry crossing across the Strait of Magellan. We got off the coach on top deck, for some fresh air and to stretch our legs and we were glad we did as we saw two Commerson Dolphin’s jumping out of the water, they looked like mini Orca’s! Sadly, they didn’t hang around long enough for a photograph. Our stop in Punta Arenas gave us enough time to get some Chilean Pesos out of an ATM, a £5 charge this time, and to get some dinner before finishing off our journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The City of Puerto Natales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puerto Natales is a small city which most people use as a hub to get to and from their treks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://torresdelpaine.com/en/&quot;&gt;Torres Del Paine National Park&lt;/a&gt;. It was much more like the South America I remembered from my trip six years ago; less westernised – no McDonalds, Starbucks or branded shops and absolutely appalling slow internet! One of the first things we noticed about Chile, was how much friendlier people here were than in neighbouring Argentina; people smiled and said ‘hola’ as they walked past. It was also full of stray dogs but they seemed friendlier than those in Ushuaia and less diseased. We weren’t sure if they were people’s pets or actual strays. One of them even followed us back to the hostel from the supermarket hoping we’d share some of our cooked chicken.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hostalarkya.com/es-es&quot;&gt;Hostel Arkya&lt;/a&gt;, which was more of a guesthouse than a hostel. We weren’t allowed to use the oven in the kitchen, which meant we had to eat out every night, but on the plus side, this was the first place we’d stayed where we were allowed to bring alcohol into the hostel rather than buying it from them. This meant even cheaper bottles of wine, so we drank plenty. One evening we ate in a Mexican Restaurant, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cervezabaguales.cl/&quot;&gt;Cerveza Baguales&lt;/a&gt; which was also a brewery. Dan managed to demolish half a kilo of chips and three taco’s. They were pretty close to British ‘chippy-chips’ except a little thinner and no vinegar. We also ate at a nicer restaurant on our last evening, El Bote, Dan had Patagonian lamb and I had stewed Guanaco, not bad!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had three days in Puerto Natales, so aside from a day tour to the National Park,we used our time to relax and mill around the city. Tour companies offered lots of activities but at £60-£100 a day, we had to choose wisely. There were some free things to do in Puerto Natales, so we wandered to look at the sculptures by the water’s edge. There were also great views of the mountains on the other side of the water. One rainy afternoon we paid a visit to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.welcomechile.com/puertonatales/municipal-historical-museum.html&quot;&gt;Municipal Historical Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which was really small but had a lot of information about the indigenous people in Chilean Patagonia, who only disappeared in early 1900’s due to Europeans settling in the area bringing disease with them. We were hoping that the museum would shed some light on the weird statues we had seen around the town, which were patterned and displayed male genitalia. It didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Torres Del Paine National Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torres Del Paine National Park was massive in comparison to Tierra Del Fuego, at least the bits where we could trek. There are a couple of circuits for trekking in Torres Del Paine, the O circuit and the W circuit. The O circuit takes 8 days and incorporates the W circuit within it, so W was shorter, 4-6 days depending on the weather. We didn’t feel fit enough or really have the time to do either of these treks so due to the park’s size, we opted for a full day tour. We went with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comapa.com/inicio&quot;&gt;Tourismo Comapa&lt;/a&gt;, which we picked randomly off the high street after realising all the companies charged the same amount. The tour cost $27,000 Chilean Pesos, which was around £32 and then we had to pay entrance fees which was the same again on top of this. Another very expensive day trip in Patagonia, but totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coach collected us at 07:30 in the morning and our first stop was the Miladon Caves. The Miladon is a prehistoric animal which looks like a giant sloth and its symbol is all over Puerto Natales. The cave has this name as its bones, fur and skin was found there. On the tour we also bumped into the Danish guy we had met in Ushuaia, who had been on our bus and who we kept seeing in town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then headed to a viewpoint of Toro Lake; the bluest lake we’ve ever seen. After this we drove to the Grey Glacier. The roads were narrow and windy, and we read on the leaflet that road accidents are common in the park. Shortly after that we saw a car that had rolled over and off the road as there were scratches all over the top. None of the tourists really seemed that shook up and no one had been hurt. Our guide radioed for help as there is no phone signal in the park and we carried on to the Grey Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to cross a suspension bridge over Grey Lake to get to the view of the glacier on the black beach; this only allowed six people to cross at a time. We had a walk along the beach and ate our sandwiches looking out at the Grey Lake and Grey Glacier. Another great view for a picnic!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then headed closer to ‘the horns’, the mountain ranges of Paine Grande Hill, Cuernos del Paine and Almirante Nueito Mount and had a lot of photo opportunities on the way. We also saw a waterfall, but after Iguazu Falls it was a little underwhelming, even with a double rainbow. We heard a thunderous noise and saw some white ‘smoke’ on the mountain, which the guide told us was an avalanche. Dan ordered a beer at the lunch time restuarant stop, the barman told us that if we walked to the other side of the hotel and went up the hill there was good views of the lake and mountain. Only a handful of people from the tour were up there so it was peaceful outlooking the lake, and they were by far the best views of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife in Torres Del Paine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came out of the mountainous part of the park and the landscape changed from mountains back to a dry desert like wilderness. We saw a herd of Guanaco’s crossing and the guide told us if we were quiet and slow we could get off the bus to see them. They looked a bit like Llama’s and now I knew what was on all of the menu’s in town.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver also  slowed down so we could watch some Emu’s as we drove past and when we got off at the last stop for a view of a lake, we saw a load of Andean Condors and some more Cararaca’s – the guide said that there must have been a dead animal where they were all congregating. We also saw Chilean Flamingo’s chilling in some of the lakes but from a bit of a distance. The second half of the day felt like we were on a Chilean safari, overall, not bad for spotting wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Puerto Natales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really loved Torres Del Paine National Park, although we felt we cheated a little by doing a day tour and not one of the hardcore circuit treks. We had perfect weather so the park looked very picturesque. Puerto Natales was a quaint little city, which gave us some time to relax and catch up on some rest before heading back to Argentina for more beautiful views of Patagonia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ushuaia]]></title><description><![CDATA[“No one will protect what they don’t care about; and no one will care about what they have never experienced.” David Attenborough.

&lt;p&gt;“No one will protect what they don’t care about; and no one will care about what they have never experienced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Attenborough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Flight Nightmare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to Dan’s love of penguins, going as far south as possible in Argentina was an absolute must. Before we left we booked a tour in Ushuaia where we could walk among wild Gentoo’s, Magellanic Penguin’s and sometimes King Penguins on an island off the coast of the Beagle Channel. Getting to Ushuaia was expensive; a coach from Buenos Aires would take days so our only realistic option was to fly so we booked a flight with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dwtltd.com/&quot;&gt;Dream World Travel&lt;/a&gt; for £126 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to the Aerolíneas Argentina check in desk at the airport, the guy told us there had been a problem with our payment and sent us to go to the ticket desk. At the ticket desk, they told us to hold on five minutes. He disappeared for around thirty minutes, leaving us to become very anxious as time was ticking and there wasn’t long left before the gate closed and we’d miss the flight. After what felt like a lifetime, the manager told us that the agency ‘Travel Junction’ (who turned out to be a vendor for Dream World Travel) hadn’t made the payment to the airline. He told us we could either ring them again ourselves and speak to them or buy new tickets; he reminded us we didn’t have long as the plane would be leaving soon. We had no SIM cards in our phones, the next flight to Ushuaia was on Monday, we had accommodation and trips booked and paid for and we had 45 minutes to pay, check in and board the flight. £375 each for a new ticket later, we ran through the airport to board the plane! Of course the flight was delayed as we were on Argentina time, so whilst we waited we wrote a strongly worded email to Dream World Travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The City of Ushuaia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ushuaia is a small city of 75,000 people and apart from having a Hard Rock Café, it doesn’t feel like a city. It has one main street, San Martin which is full of shops, bars, restaurants and tourist information centres. There hadn’t been many stray dogs in Buenos Aires but there were loads in Ushuaia. A lot of them were just laid on the streets, they looked full of disease so despite having our rabies injections we resisted the temptation to stroke them. On our last night in Ushuaia, we declined an invite to go to a salsa bar and we went to the famous irish bar Dublin Pub instead. It was packed and seemed that everyone in Ushuaia came here at night. We weren’t sure why as it was packed, expensive and served green beer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ushuaia reminded us of places like Reykjavik in Iceland and Tromso in Norway, which in the past we have quickly fallen in love with. We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://antarcticahostel.com/&quot;&gt;Antarctica Hostel&lt;/a&gt; which again had a hostel cat! Dan said this one was his favourite as he was noisy and one night let himself into a dorm and fell asleep on someone’s bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met a lot of people staying here, including a Danish guy and a woman from Florida, who had come back from Antarctica and we were both very envious of their experiences. They told us about their time kayaking with whales and seeing the penguins in Antarctica. However, they also told us that the boat, on its way there and back, had rocked for 4 days, to the point where almost everyone was sick and people were huddled in the corner with life jackets on, sure they were going to die. It also cost them around $8000. Going to Antarctica was definitely well out of our budget!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Glacier Martial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The receptionist at the hostel had recommended several things to do in Ushuaia, one of them was a hike to Glacier Martial. He told us that most people get a taxi up for around $200ARS (£7) and then walk back down. He said it was 1.5 hours each way. As it was free to see the glacier, on the first day we got a taxi up there. It then turned out that from that point it was a 1.5 hour hike up to see the glacier, all uphill. We set off with our tree branch walking sticks that were at the entrance and made our way slowly to the glacier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some stunning views of Ushuaia and the Beagle Channel on the way and the surroundings made us feel like we were in Lord of the Rings. Annoyingly the view of the glacier had been better further away than at the end of the hike but at least we had done it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tierra Del Fuego National Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few different ways to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/en/tierra-del-fuego-national-park/&quot;&gt;Tierra Del Fuego National Park&lt;/a&gt; and one of them that we’d looked into was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.trendelfindelmundo.com.ar/en/tarifas.html&quot;&gt;The End of the World Train&lt;/a&gt;. This used to transport prisoner’s from Ushuaia’s prison to work in the park. However, getting the train would only allow us to see a small part of the park and it was $850ARS (£30) on top of getting there and the park entrance fees. We went with the hostel’s recommendation and booked a bus there and back for $500ARS (£17) and then planned to walk the trails on our own. Armed with a photocopied map we followed the yellow posts around the park. The first trail we did was the Costera Trail (8km long) through the forest next to Lapataia Bay, it took us three hours. Unlike Ilha Grande, there wasn’t much wildlife to look out for, although we did see a Chimango Caracara up pretty close. What struck us was how quiet and peaceful the national park was, there was no sounds of people, traffic, insects or even water. Just pure silence.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second trail we did was to Roca Lake and was only a 3 kilometre round trip. It was a great view so we braved the cold and stopped for a picnic. After this we did lots of little trails making our way to Lapataia Bay to the bus stop. The buses back came at 15:00, 17:00 and 19:00 and after being dropped off around 09:00 and our legs feeling like they were going to fall off by 13:00, we were keen to get the first bus back to the city. After walking Paseo De La Isla and past Laguna Verde we made it to the end of the trail and to the bus stop just in time for the 15:00 bus. We were also rewarded with the sign marking the end of the Pan-American highway, spanning from Alaska to Ushuaia. Literally the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expected the national park to be busy with lots of tourists on the trails, however it seemed that more people did the day tours on the coaches. This dropped them at the main viewpoints of the park so these places were a little bit busier, but on the trails there was no one around. How we didn’t get lost with our inaccurate paper map, lack of any kind of directions or signs and no proper hiking gear we’ll never know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Penguin Rookery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was definitely the highlight of our trip so far. Our tour, booked through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.piratour.net/en/&quot;&gt;Piratour&lt;/a&gt; took us to an island called Isla Martillo, where a colony of Magellanic Penguin’s live during the summer months to have their chicks in their burrows. They’d had their chicks in December so they were now adults. We’d also come at a time where they were moulting and were skinny from being on land for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to walk between their burrows and were told we could get up to two metres close to them but no closer. The guide told us that any closer would stress them out as their eyes would not be able to focus on us. He told us that they are not afraid of humans as long as they can see us. The penguin’s were mostly in two’s, pruning each other and some were in their burrows. They were also a lot less smelly than we’d anticipated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time with these penguins, the guides took us round to the beach, where there was a colony of Gentoo Penguins. On the way we saw a vulture devouring a dead penguin by the sea. The guides told us that the Gentoo’s stay on the island all year long and we saw 4-5 come out of the sea onto the beach after catching some fish. One of them waddled all the way up the beach to join the rest of the colony.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent an hour on the island, as it’s all that’s allowed so that the penguins do not become stressed. Piratour seemed to be the only company that offered tours to Isla Martillo and they were really strict about what we were and weren’t allowed to do on the island, so it didn’t feel like a tourist trap and felt that they actually cared about the penguins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the penguins, we had a hot chocolate in a cute little teahouse and then were taken to Acatushun Museum for a guided tour. This was really random, a little hut in the middle of nowhere full of bones that scientists have found washed up in Tierra Del Fuego of whales, dolphins and birds. We were also shown the lab where volunteers live, work and clean the bones. It stunk of a mixture of decaying flesh and freshly made cookies. A really bizarre end to our tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Ushuaia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the opportunity to walk between the penguins in their natural habit was incredible, like a real life episode of Planet Earth. It will certainly be difficult to beat! Hiking for hours through Tierra Del Fuego was also an experience as it’s a beautiful part of the world to explore. Annoying, but definitely worth the extra £375 to get there.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Buenos Aires]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Without the streets nor dusks of Buenos Aires a Tango cannot be written.” Jorge Luis Borges.

&lt;p&gt;“Without the streets nor dusks of Buenos Aires a Tango cannot be written.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jorge Luis Borges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transport &amp;#x26; Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to Buenos Aires we took a bus from Puerto Iguazu, which cost us £80 and took 19 hours in total; it left at 14:00 and arrived at 09:00 the following day. We paid for ‘executive’ seats which were more like first class seats on an airplane.  We were given three meals, mostly bread and crackers, there was a TV with films dubbed in Spanish and we were given a small bottle of red wine with our meal. Our first taste of Malbec in Argentina. During the night we drove for hours through thunderstorms, with the lightening lighting up the sky every few seconds, luckily we couldn’t hear the thunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stayed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://puertolimonhostel.com/en/&quot;&gt;Puerto Limon Hostel&lt;/a&gt; which is easily our favourite hostel of the trip so far. The staff were friendly and there was a hostel cat called Max who Dan took a liking to. After Alz left we stayed in a private room which had cable TV, so I was able to watch Disney films dubbed in Spanish and it had a bath, so Dan was happy. The wine in the hostel was also $75ARS, which is around £2.70 for a good bottle of Malbec, #winning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;San Telmo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buenos Aires is a massive city and the hostel was in the oldest barrio San Telmo, which was very picturesque. It had cobbled streets and bars with tables set out in the plaza’s and on the streets. On Sunday there was a huge market which spanned down more blocks than we could walk down, selling lots of local crafts. Dan managed to find a cheap leather belt for his now too big Levi’s and we both bought new football shirts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could hardly go to Argentina and not go out for steak and wine, so we did, twice. We ate in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parrillalabrigada.com.ar/&quot;&gt;La Brigada&lt;/a&gt;, a restaurant recommended by the hostel for the best steak in the area. There were so many cuts of beef we managed to try t-bone, lomo (sirloin), tail of lomo and beef of chorizo; all mouth wateringly delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the immigrants settling in Buenos Aires from 1857-1940, there is an obvious Italian influence throughout the city. This has also shaped the way Argentinians speak Spanish, as beer is birra not cerveza. So, we thought we ought to eat at one of the many pizza restaurants too. We’d been warned that people think that the Argentine pizza is too cheesy, I didn’t think this was possible, but it really was! Dan had also researched a place called &lt;a href=&quot;http://thechickenbros.com/&quot;&gt;Chicken Bros&lt;/a&gt; which sold all you can eat chicken wings on a Tuesday, so it was inevitable that we were going to end up eating there too. We ate around 70 chicken wings in total, pure gluttony!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;City Centre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As day three of Lollapalooza was cancelled we decided not to waste our time in Buenos Aires and we did the first of three &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buenosairesfreewalks.com/&quot;&gt;free walking tours&lt;/a&gt;, excessive we know. Our guide Fernando told us about how Argentina became a country and stories of the first people to settle there. He talked to us about Eva Peron, the first lady of Argentina from 1946-1952 who the nation loved and who Madonna played in the film Evita. He also showed us the Italian and Parisian architectual influences in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Recoleta Cemetery was one of the more peaceful places in the city. It was nice to get away for a short while from all the people shouting “cambio, cambio, cambio” at us on the streets of Buenos Aires, asking for us to exchange our money for their probably fake Argentine Pesos at their dodgy rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;La Boca&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to see a Tango show whilst we were in Buenos Aires but they were pretty pricey and the cheaper ones offered a lesson thrown in which Dan point blank refused to participate in. We’d heard that there were Tango performers in the barrio La Boca on Caminito so we headed to this area on the local bus to do some exploring. The boys were happy with this too as it meant a museum and stadium tour of La Bombonera, Boca Juniors football ground. We did a walking tour of the area as we’d been warned about theft at gunpoint in La Boca and to be aware of our belongings. Maru, our guide, told us about the area’s history and how the immigrants that came to populate Argentina ended up there. She also told us about the birth of Tango and a guy in La Boca let us look inside his house where he had lived for 40 years. He told us that at one point he lived with 11 other families all sharing one bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very vibrant and colourful part of the city which made for some great photographs. Maru explained that the origin of this came from people using scraps of material from the port to build their houses, included scraps of paint, meaning that they ended up being bright and multicoloured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a look around &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stadiumguide.com/bombonera/&quot;&gt;La Bombonera&lt;/a&gt;, which didn’t take long as the ground was tiny! We’d learnt on the tour that the people in the houses around the stadium had gone back on their agreement to sell their properties, so they could only build half of the stadium which is why it is so small. After the tour we stopped for a beer and watched the Tango dancers for a tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Palermo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to Palermo on our last day for a graffiti walking tour. We’d heard that as a city Buenos Aires was tolerant of street art and often commissioned artists to paint their houses, a lot of which occurred in Palermo. As soon as we walked into Palermo we realised we’d found the ‘hipster’ neighbourhood, full of bars selling craft beers and vintage shops. We spent the afternoon photographing the art in this area of the city and drank a few South American honey beers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Buenos Aires&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buenos Aires is a huge city with different districts; each one with its own style and personality. Our personal favourite was Palermo, with its quirky bars, vintage shops and graffiti on every block. We also tasted the best steak we’d ever had in San Telmo accompanied with a delicious bottle of Malbec which was for once within our budget.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lollapalooza Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[“You lot are the best crowd I’ve ever performed in front of.” Liam Gallagher, Lollapalooza 2018, Argentina.

&lt;p&gt;“You lot are the best crowd I’ve ever performed in front of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liam Gallagher, Lollapalooza 2018, Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lollapalooza Argentina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were lucky enough to get tickets to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lollapaloozaar.com/&quot;&gt;Lollapalooza&lt;/a&gt; before we left the UK. It was after that we did some more research and found out that due to the laws in Argentina, alcohol cannot be sold at events that children can attend, which meant a sober music festival. Whilst breaking the news gently to Alz, we asked him what the worst thing was that could happen at Lolla, his first answer was that it was vegan, then he realised that it was the unthinkable and there was no alcohol. We had some thoughts about burying some or buying scarves with bags hidden in them to sneak some in, but the festival seemed strict. We decided to just accept it, after all, it could have been worse and been vegan!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our thoughts were right, Lollapalooza turned out to be very strict; on the first day they searched our bags twice and confiscated my biro, paracetamol, antihistamine and bite cream. The security woman contemplated confiscating my inhaler too but went with her better judgement and let me keep it. Security even searched through Dan’s snotty tissue in case he was hiding anything in there. Standards must have slipped after we got in and as the day went on because by 18:00 a lot of people in the festival were getting high on their smuggled in cannabis. But all was OK because at least I couldn’t dish out my paracetamol and antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t help comparing Lollapalooza to Glastonbury, which will always remain our absolute favourite music festival. In comparison, Lollapalooza was small with four stages for music, it also had a cashless system where wristbands had to be topped up and this was the only way to buy anything there. It had overpriced burger vans and ridiculously priced water which we had no choice other than to buy as the festival did not allow us to bring in our own food and drink. We did manage to find probably the best food at the festival and after a 45-minute queue had Rocking Chips with ketchup, bacon and spring onion. We were also pleasantly surprised that Lolla did turn out to sell alcohol! Alz was feeling better at this point and he managed to sniff out the Corona Beer Garden, so after getting our ID checked three times we were allowed our two per-day allowance of Corona. Hoorah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lolla was held at San Isidro which was around 45 minutes out of the city; getting the two metros and a train there and back was an absolute nightmare. Imagine thousands of people trying to catch a train back to the city at the same time after the headliners, it was carnage. The first night took us three hours to get back to San Telmo after a very long queue outside the train station and being squeezed onto an overly packed train. The second night we left 10 minutes early, missing The Killer’s ‘Mr Brightside’, a blessing in disguise really and managed to get back at a decent time and with room to breathe on the train.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music wise, the line-up was awesome, in the first two days we saw Oh Wonder, Spoon,Royal Blood, Imagine Dragons, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metronomy, Liam Gallagher and The Killers. They all put on a great show and made attempts to speak to the crowd in Spanish. All aside from Liam Gallagher who is of course far too arrogant to even say ‘muchas gracias’. However, he did tell the crowd that we were the best he had ever performed in front of! Due to horrific thunderstorms, which may have been summoned by Imagine Dragons when they performed ‘Thunder’, the third day of the festival was cancelled by the government, and we missed out on Milky Chance, LCD Soundsystem, Pearl Jam, Galantis and Kygo. During the night after the second day the thunder was so loud it set off car alarms, and one of the guys in the hostel said that the lightening had burnt up half of one of the stages at Lolla. People had also posted pictures on Facebook of San Isidro flooded and looking even muddier than Glastonbury. Lolla announced that they cancelled the third day of the festival in the interest of people’s safety and promised to reimburse everyone a third of the cost of the festival. Money we happily spent on more steak and wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Lollapalooza Argentina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music at Lollapalooza was of course amazing, however the poor planning and organisation of the festival let it down a little. We also think we’ve been totally spoilt by Glastonbury which has everything perfected to a tee. No festival will ever match up to its greatness, we’ll be coming for you Glastonbury 2019.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sao Paulo & Iguazu Falls]]></title><description><![CDATA[“There is a hidden message in every waterfall.

&lt;p&gt;“There is a hidden message in every waterfall. It says, if you are flexible, falling will not hurt you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mehmet Murat Ildan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One night in São Paulo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used São Paulo to break up our journey as we made our way to Foz do Iguaçu from Paraty. We spent less than 24 hours there and ended up eating our dinner in a shopping mall. As soon as we stepped out of the Metro station and onto the huge boulevard, it became evident as to why São Paulo is known as the ‘financial capital’ of Brazil. There were huge glass skyscrapers on each side of the road, uniquely shaped buildings and three lanes of traffic on each side of the boulevards. However, there was still a sense of underlying poverty in the city. On our walk back from the mall we saw two young boys hitting an empty glass bottle of vodka against the curb until it smashed. They cheered and then jumped onto the doorway of a bus as it was driving off, until the driver opened the door and it shoved them off. They were wearing scruffy clothes and one of them couldn’t have been older than seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had an interesting encounter on the Metro when we arrived, as three young men approached us and asked if we liked Tango. They proceeded to play Tango music right in front of us on their guitars and bandoneón for a couple of stops. What surprised us was that most people on the carriage applauded when they had finished and tipped them. If we had been in England, most people would have looked at their phones and pretended they hadn’t heard anything. We did as the locals did and gave them some of our Brazilian real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehostelpaulista.com.br/pt-br&quot;&gt;Hostel Paulista&lt;/a&gt; goes on our list of one of the grimmest places we’ve stayed. The mattresses were covered in blue plastic, the pillows in a plastic bag and Alz wasn’t provided with a blanket. The bathrooms were another matter altogether, the door had come off the women’s toilet, there were no locks on the showers and there was no toilet paper anywhere in sight after around 10PM. Safe to say after one night, we were glad to leave and carry on with our journey to Foz do Iguaçu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foz do Iguaçu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got off the plane in Foz do Iguaçu, the warm air hit us as we were back in temperatures of around 34C, even the breeze was warm. We opted for a local bus to get us to the hostel as the town seemed small. Getting on the bus with two backpack’s on, one on our back and the other on our front was a nightmare, as the bus had a pointless turnstile in the middle of it, which we had to go through once we’d paid. The woman accepting money for tickets got so annoyed with me trying to get through, she took my backpack from me and threw it over the turnstiles.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had booked to stay at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tetrishostel.com.br/&quot;&gt;Tetris Hostel&lt;/a&gt;, made of shipping containers stacked on top of each other. We were shown to our 12 bed dormitory which was sweltering hot. We immediately thought that staying in a metal containers in such high temperatures was a mistake. However, the hostel offered free Caipriniha’s from 8:00-8:30PM which made it much more bareable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iguazu Falls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on our bucket list and one of the seven natural wonders of the world, we had always expected &lt;a href=&quot;https://iguazufalls.com/national-park/&quot;&gt;Iguazu Falls&lt;/a&gt; to be spectacular. What we didn’t expect was how long the waterfalls went on for and how big the National Park was, particularly on the Argentinian side. It was so huge we had to ride trains to get around. There are between 150-300 waterfalls in the park depending on the season, leading up to the big one Garganta del Diablo or ‘Devils Throat’.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Brazilian side, the platform out to Garganta del Diablo allowed us to walk to the middle of the river and look through either side of the falls. It was really loud and so powerful, that even from such a distance we were sprayed with the mist caused by the force of the water as hit the rocks. On the Argentinian side, we walked a platform across the top and watched the water as it pummelled down the rocks. The mist was so thick you couldn’t see the rest of the falls or the platform out on the Brazilian side. However, because of the sunshine and the mist, there were some vibrant rainbows that helped to make the perfect photo.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also walked the upper and lower trails on the Argentinian side of the falls, which other than seeing the top of Garganta del Diablo, was probably our favourite part of the park because of all of the wildlife we saw. The lower trail also took us very close to a waterfall which was so violent it soaked us with it’s spray and mist, and the water was so loud we had to shout at one another to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were butterflies everywhere in the park, landing on our arms, bags and on people’s heads. Some people held out bits of fruit to attract them and the butterflies would sit on their hands for ages enjoying the sweet fruits. There were also Coati, racoon-like scavengers and there were warnings everywhere about them attacking people for food and that they may have rabies. We saw one woman stupidly sat on a bench eating some biscuits and when a Coati tried to jump up her, she kicked it away. They were however, deceivingly cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there were more walks through the park on the Argentinian side, we saw a lot more wildlife there. There were lots and lots of spiders, some which had made their webs over our heads on the trails, we quickly ran under those. We also spotted a really colourful Toucan up in the tree’s; I managed to snap a photograph before it was scared off by guided tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One even came into the crowd of people on it’s two legs, and because everyone was so busy taking pictures of the monkey’s in the trees, no one even noticed. Dan got a pretty good photo of it waving to everyone looking very cheeky.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if the day hadn’t been exciting enough, on one of our train journeys a jeep went past and in the front was a short haired blonde woman, looking very cool eating her ice cream - she looked remarkably like Katy Perry. As it turned out, she was Katy Perry. We heard one of the staff members later telling people she had come today and her presence at Iguazu Falls had even made the local news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crossing the Border&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d heard some horror stories about our intial plan of local transport to cross the border, where buses hadn’t stopped for people to be stamped out of Brazil leading to hefty fines. We got chatting to a Canadian girl in the hostel and she easily convinced us to share a taxi with her and a couple from England to cross the border to the Argentinian side of the falls, which was hassle free and cheaper than the hostel’s day trip to the Argentinian side. The hostel arranged this for us, however when the taxi came, the driver refused to take us as 4 of us had luggage. As it was nonsensical to pay double for two taxi’s on our budgets we went our separate ways and headed for the local bus stop. In actual fact it was pretty straight forward crossing the border from Brazil to Argentina; one bus to the Brazilian border, one bus to the Argentinian border and then another to the bus terminal in Puerto Iguazú. After an hour and a half, we were finally in Argentina and had to rembember to switch from obrigada to gracias. De nada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First thoughts on Argentina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dumped our bags at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.porambahostel.com/&quot;&gt;Poramba Hostel&lt;/a&gt; and headed into town to get some cash out of the ATM so we could head to the falls. The ATM charged us $240ARS (£8.54) to withdraw cash which was a bit of a shock. Apparently standard in the whole of Argentina! The bus was also £5.35 to the falls instead of the 80p it had been the Brazilian side; it became evident very quickly that it would be harder to stick to our budget in Argentina! It had been so much easier in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict Iguazu Falls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we’d initially done our research, people had recommended to visit both sides of the falls and we would totally agree with this. The Brazilian side gives great views from the bottom, but the Argentinian side is huge with unexpected surprises such as Toucan’s, monkeys and if your lucky even a celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ilha Grande & Paraty]]></title><description><![CDATA[“Is it normal to have sweaty ears?

&lt;p&gt;“Is it normal to have sweaty ears? I’ve never had a sweaty ear in my life… They’re not even doing anything and they’re hot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Pilkington on Brazilian weather, An Idiot Abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arriving at Ilha Grande&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four busy days in Rio de Janiero, we’d planned to spend some time relaxing on the beaches of Ilha Grande. We booked a door to door transfer with &lt;a href=&quot;http://easytransferbrazil.com/en/&quot;&gt;Easy Transfers&lt;/a&gt; from Rio to Ilha Grande, we were collected at 07:00 and taken straight to the island; it was around a 3 hour drive and 45 minutes on a slow boat. We sat on the top deck and enjoyed the sunshine and a few beers until we got there. As we approached the ‘Big Island’ we could see why people in Rio had raved about how beautiful it was. There was a small stretch of bars, restaurants and pousada’s, coves of beaches and a pier towered by green hills covering the rest of the island. Dan said that it looked like ‘that island’ from Moana; he meant Te Fiti. The island was supposed to be very secluded with no cars and no ATMS, however on one of our treks we saw a bus full of tourists on the jungle path driving to Dios Rios. Definitely no banks or ATM’s though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the town was so small it didn’t take us long to reach &lt;a href=&quot;http://biergartenhostel.blogspot.com.br/&quot;&gt;Biergarten Hostel&lt;/a&gt;, where we had booked in an 8 bed dormitory to stay. It had two hammocks just outside our room and an odd shaped bench in the kitchen which Alz kept stubbing his toes on.  There was also a buffet style kilo restaurant attached, where we paid for the weight of food on our plates. On our second night in the hostel, new people came into the dorm, including two of the guys who had been at Books Hostel in Rio. One of them was Norweigian and had spent a night in Rio chatting to Alz about politics and finance over Caipirinhas; we joked that Alz had pulled so found it hilarious when he, by coincidence, ended up in our dormitory in the hostel on Ilha Grande. The second guy was from Bristol and snored like a fog horn; he was so loud my Harry Potter audiobook couldn’t drown him out, but at least we got to catch up on some sleep snoozing on the beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wildlife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common animal we saw on the island were dogs. Lots and lots of dogs. They were everywhere, pooing on the beach, begging for food at night and walking the jungle trails to other parts of the island. We even saw a dead one, decomposing and washed up on the beach by the tide. Dan was highly amused by one dog who had dug a hole in the sand, was sat in it and was wearing a green tie. Some of the dogs seemed to have owners but others were strays and it was upsetting to see them so skinny and begging for food. It also meant that there was poo on the paths and main beach in Vila do Abraão, so we ended up spending most of our time in the little cove beaches slightly out of town.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our first night on the island we spotted a couple of Black Tufted-ear Marmoset’s in the Vila do Abraão on the electric wires, I managed to take one photo before they ran off and disappeared. As we had read that there were howler monkey’s on the island, we decided to do a bit of a walk through the jungle on the second day to see if we could see any. This wasn’t supposed to be for long as we wanted to chill out on the beach; we were also wearing sandals and had about half a bottle of water between us. As we reached the beginning of the trail, there was  a warning about mosquitos carrying yellow fever. We’d had our vaccinations but Alz hadn’t. He decided to come with anyway as the vaccination hadn’t been compulsory to visit Brazil and armed himself with insect repellent. We ended up walking along a trail to Dois Rios, which was on the opposite side of the island and at one point we became determined to do the 3-4 hour trek all the way there. However, after reaching a viewpoint we turned back as we were out of water and according to the map we were only about one third of the way there; the sun was out and it was midday so carrying on seemed like a stupid idea. The view was stunning of the bay and it was well worth the hour walk there and back. Sadly, we didn’t see any monkeys, just big ants, butterflies, a few types of birds and a great big spider.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we felt like we’d failed the trail the day before, the next day we decided to hike to Lopes Mendes rather than take the boat trip. This was a 3-hour trek and we were way more prepared, armed with snacks, lots of water, DEET and walking boots. We followed the signs from Vila do Abraão to Lopes Mendes and once we got off the beach and into the jungle we questioned what we’d let ourselves in for. The beginning of the trek was so steep; climbing up steps naturally made from tree roots and holes in the clay ground. We were all soaking in sweat within about 30 seconds and only saw one other person walking the trail who over took us, so it felt like we had the jungle to ourselves. The first part of the hike took us about 2 hours to the first beach, Enseada das Palmas. This was also pretty much deserted, and it was tempting to just stop there; however, we’d read that Lopes Mendes was one of the best beaches in Brazil. We had another 40-minute walk through the jungle to get to the next beach Praia do Pouso and from there we booked our speedboat water taxi back to Vila do Abraão for later in the afternoon. To reach Lopes Mendes we had another 20-minute walk through the jungle, this bit was busier with other visitors who had taken boats from Vila do Abraão to Praia do Pouso, as the boats did not go straight to Lopes Mendes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lopes Mendes delivered as promised. The beach was huge and secluded, there were no restaurants or pousada’s there, just a couple of men with their carts selling drinks and snacks. The sand was white and so fine, as we walked along the beach it squeaked beneath our feet. The sea was crystal clear, warm and it was so shallow we could go out really far and the water was only up to our waists.  Even though we were knackered when we got to Lopes Mendes, we felt a sense of achievement. It was well worth the 3 hour trek across the island to get there but we were exceptionally grateful for the speedboat back to Vila do Abraão.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long day we ate at a restaurant called Steak n’ Beach and had a huge mixed grill for the three of us. It came on a sizziling hot plate and consisted of two pork chops, two steaks, two chicken breasts and four Brazilian sausages, accompanied with a bowl of rice, a mound of chips and some salsa. It cost us $145R which is around £32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paraty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days on Ilha Grande we left for Paraty on our Easy Transfer and it took around 4 hours to reach the town from the island. The weather was overcast and it rained for half of our time in Paraty. On our walking tour in Rio, the guide had said that we had come to Brazil at a time where the seasons were changing which meant that the weather was hot but with some rain in the afternoon. Because of the weather, there wasn’t a lot to do in Paraty. I also felt a little unwell and Alz developed a fever, headache, muscle ache and loss of appetite. He googled his symptoms and decided it was likely he had yellow fever. It turned out that in November 2017 an outbreak of yellow fever had started in the State of Rio de Janiero and State of Sao Paulo; worsening in January 2018. Specifically people had contracted the disease on Ilha Grande!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason the free walking tours had been cancelled in Paraty and we didn’t want to risk a boat trip or a bus ride to Trindade to spend the day on the beach as it kept raining on and off. Therefore, we milled around the old town which was very picturesque, with its colourful boats, buildings and cobbled streets. The people of Paraty also seemed to have a fondness for classic VW Beetles, which were colourful and matched the style of the town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was here that we finally saw more monkeys! We were having breakfast in our hostel, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sambacanutahostel/&quot;&gt;Samba Canuta&lt;/a&gt; and the staff told us that there were monkeys in the tree’s, they tried to coax them down with banana’s but they were having none of it. They lingered around long enough for me to get some good pictures on my camera though.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The hostel itself was very quiet and we were pretty much the only guests staying there, which made the communal areas very awkward as all the staff seemed to do all day was play guitar and sing the Portuguese version of the Eagle’s ‘Hotel California’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verdict on Ilha Grande &amp;#x26; Paraty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ilha Grande didn’t turn out to be such a relaxing destination after all as we did lots of hiking through the jungle across the island. We ended up with around 30 mosquito bites between us but totally worth it for the beautiful views and beaches. Following this, we enjoyed our chilled out time in Paraty; a beautiful colonial town with lots of character that wasn’t even the rain couldn’t spoil.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rio De Janeiro]]></title><description><![CDATA[“I sorta think from a distance… Jesus, top of a hill, lookin’ like he’s about to bungee jump, you pass it, you go, ‘There he is.

&lt;p&gt;“I sorta think from a distance… Jesus, top of a hill, lookin’ like he’s about to bungee jump, you pass it, you go, ‘There he is. Great. What else are we doin’?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Pilkington, An Idiot Abroad (not bitter at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arriving in Rio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we left for Rio, we were told in many ways about how dangerous it is there. We did a bit of research the night before and read about the trouble following the Rio Olympics. The government arrested some people to make the favela’s safe and promised to make the them better. The Olympics came and went and the government didn’t follow through with any of their promises to improve things such as health and education, which resulted in the violence within the favelas escalating. It seemed from google maps that our hostel was also surrounded by favela’s and we then read that because of the trouble there, the military had taken over the city. Felipe running &lt;a href=&quot;http://bookshostel.com/&quot;&gt;Books Hostel&lt;/a&gt;, where we were staying had also warned us not to take money out at the airport due to credit cards being cloned. To make matters worse, when we arrived in Portugal for a stop over, the lady running the hostel told us about her daughter who had been to Carnival a few weeks ago. She had been staying in Leblon, an area close to the biggest favela in Rio, Rochina, she had heard gunshots in Leblon and saw lots of people running away from the area. She warned us to be careful. This made us question why we were starting our trip in Rio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a horrendous flight we arranged a transfer with the hostel as we arrived so late. The driver pulled up in a Fiat with absolutely blacked out windows and drove us through the streets of Rio, we managed to see Christ the Redeemer lit up on Corcovado mountain. No crimes were witnessed in our first hour of Rio, however at traffic lights we heard people chanting and I thought there was going to be a protest or some sort of gang violence around the corner, it turned out to be football fans chanting in a bar following a Flamengo goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we did in Rio was head to the beach. The guy at the hostel recommended Gloria Beach, which he said was walkable. We didn’t take any valuables with us whilst we were still sussing the city out. However, our visit was trouble free, the sand was white and we had a great view of Sugarloaf Mountain and of Christ, when he didn’t disappear behind the clouds. The people selling beer and drinks were very friendly and it seemed to be full of locals jogging or sunbathing. As it is so infamous, we then got an Uber to Copacabana beach, Dan and Alz warned me that I would prefer Gloria and they were right. Every thirty seconds someone was in our face trying to sell something, sunglasses, empanadas, bikinis, canga (sarongs), caipirinhas and weed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last day in Rio, we did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freewalkertours.com/&quot;&gt;free walking tour&lt;/a&gt; of the Copacabana and Ipanema area. Our guide told us about the World Cup and how everyone gathered in front of the big screens to watch the games on the beach. We went to the restaurant where “The Girl from Ipanema” was written and walked to Lagoa Rodrigues de Freitas, a big lake, to watch the sun go down. The guide gave us some Brazilian snacks to try including Biscoto Globo, a weird banana sweet and some Guarana, an energy drink that tastes like red bull. By this time, we felt much more comfortable and confident in Rio and walked around the most expensive part of town to find some food after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Christ The Redeemer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had seen Christ the Redeemer lit up at night and from Gloria beach, but what’s a trip to Rio without seeing the wonder of the world up close. Following some advice from a dutch girl on our free walking tour of Downtown and Lapa, we decided to do as she did and get an Uber up Corcovado Mountain to see him in all his glory. The driver spoke no english and on the way either stopped in front of a favela to ask for directions or tried to drive through it, we’re still not sure. Either way, luckily a guy wearing an official guide t-shirt turned him away or told him the right way to go. After getting to the top, we went to buy our ticket, only to be told that there was no visibility at all and the live camera on Christ was just pure white from the cloud. We waited for some time and the boys had more beers, but the cloud didn’t shift and in the end we had to give up and pay excessive amounts to get back down the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on ‘Christ watch’ for the rest of the time in Rio, trying to catch a glimpse of him in a clear sky,  meaning we might get the opportunity to go up again. However, during the last two days of our trip he was completely covered by cloud, except for around thirty seconds when we were watching the sunset on our last night, he peeped out just to rub our noses in the fact that we hadn’t been able to see him up close during our time in Rio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Art &amp;#x26; Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the full Rio experience we decided to do a couple of walking tours to learn about the history and culture of the city. On the tour of Downtown and Lapa we tried Coxinhas, breaded chicken balls with cheese inside (that tasted a bit like mac and cheese balls) and ended up at the bright tiled steps ‘Escadaria Selaron’, a gift from Jorge Selaron to the city which took him over 23 years to finish. They were really bright and vibrant and one of our favourite parts of the Rio, leading to the Santa Teresa neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a wander to Olympic Boulevard during a pretty loud thunderstorm, one strike of lightning was so close and so loud it made the lady crossing the road next to Alz grab his arm. At Olympic Boulevard we saw probably the best street art we’ve seen in any city we’ve been to so far. It was a huge mural by Eduardo Kobra completed for the Olympics; it was so colourful and vibrant and represented the five continents of the games. On the way we also visited the very ugly Cathedral which is inspired by a Mayan Pyramid, Dan repeatedly told us that “beauty comes from within”. It looked a bit like the old Birmingham Library before it was torn down.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a good view of the city, we decided instead of paying extortionate amounts for Sugarloaf and risking the cloud of Corcovado Mountain we walked up the very steep hill to Santa Teresa, the hipster ‘foodie’ area of Rio. On the way Alz got a bit cocky and jumped up a steep step, resulting in his shorts tearing along the crotch. We got a good panoramic view of the city from Parque Das Ruinas, except for Christ, who remained behind the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Rio seeming to be a city that never sleeps, where the fruit and vegetable stores are open until the early hours of the morning, we had heard that the city is very quiet on a Sunday, and what we heard wasn’t a lie. The only places open seemed to be McDonalds and Starbucks. As there wasn’t a lot to do, we went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://visit.rio/en/que_fazer/mam2/&quot;&gt;Modern Art Museum&lt;/a&gt;, Alz and Dan particularly enjoyed mocking Giacometti’s “Four Women on Base”. We then went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mhn.museus.gov.br/&quot;&gt;Museu Historico Nacional&lt;/a&gt; which was free on a Sunday; we pretty much had the museum to ourselves as it was so quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food &amp;#x26; Caipirinhas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hostel we stayed in sold £1 Caipirinhas, either lime or passionfruit and we definitely had our fill of these. They have possibly rocketed to one of our favourite cocktails. Something which took some time getting used to was that everyone shared 600ml bottles of beer, we got very strange looks when we tried to order one each so followed the Carioca trend and shared and drank from teeny tiny glasses. On Alz’s birthday we went to a local restaurant called Os Ximenes; we had two massive steaks, Brazilian sausage, scrambled egg in Farofa, a tasteless brazilian flour, rice and chips. It was delicious although covered in about three bulbs of diced garlic. Safe to say we stank the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Verdict on Rio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from being hot, Rio really wasn’t what we had expected it to be, it was so much better. It was diverse, colourful, vibrant and full of life. We barely touched the surface in four days and as we didn’t get to see Christ the Redeemer up close, one day we’ll definitely go back.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
