We paid $22 (£16.60) tourist tax and waited for a boat to Chichime Island, nicknamed Paradise Island, where we would be staying.</p>\\n<p>The sky was a little grey so we were worried about the weather as we made our way to the island, which took a little over an hour. However, once we arrived, the sky cleared up and we had sun and blue skies for the rest of the day. San Blas was idyllic, there were lots and lots of islands made up of white sand, blue sea and palm trees dotted all through the ocean.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/boat-89b481cf1ff32aa3ef0c4e6bbbe4173a-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Boat\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Boat\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/boat-89b481cf1ff32aa3ef0c4e6bbbe4173a-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/boat-89b481cf1ff32aa3ef0c4e6bbbe4173a-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/boat-89b481cf1ff32aa3ef0c4e6bbbe4173a-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/boat-89b481cf1ff32aa3ef0c4e6bbbe4173a-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>The cabin we were staying in was really basic, basically a bamboo shack on the beach, with tarpulin to keep the rain out and a double bed with a mosquito net.

Finally, we headed to Perro Island which was idyllic, a gorgeous beach with a small bar and a swing. There was also a shipwreck just off shore which we could snorkel around. As we’d only hired one snorkel and mask Dan went first but put me off telling me it was really deep, dark and he’d seen three jellyfish.
