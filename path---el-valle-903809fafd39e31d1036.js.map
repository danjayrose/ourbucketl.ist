Mamallena wasn’t in a very nice area of Panama and the style of the hostel made it feel more like we were by the coast than in the middle of a bustling city.</p>\\n<p>We decided to go to El Valle for a couple of nights and caught the bus for $4.25 (£3.22). Nick and Char decided to join us for a night as we’d decided to do a hike they hadn’t yet done . It took 2.5 hours to get there from the city and we were plesantly suprised as to how quiet and green it was; El Valle turned out to be a beautiful town in the middle of a dormant volcano crater. We stayed the first night in <a href=\\\"https://www.bodhihostels.com\\\">Bodhi Hostel</a> with Nick and Char and made the most of the hostels pancake breakfast and delicious smoothies.</p>\\n<h2>El Serpentario</h2>\\n<p>We had planned to rent bikes and go to a waterfall nearby but as the weather was threatening to rain, after having a look around the local market we headed to the Snake Zoo rescue centre. This was only around a 20 minute walk from the hostel and cost $3 to enter. It wasn’t a very big rescue centre, with a few caiman, turtles and a lot of snakes. The guide told us that sometimes they have rescued sloths there too but at that time they didn’t. He showed us some of the different types of snakes and showed us two vipers, fer-de-lance, the most deadly snake and the most common in Panama. The guide let us hold a rainbow snake which they call Lola and have as a ‘pet’.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/snake-9a1c5a234836838038e49c91384609b1-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Snake\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Snake\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/snake-9a1c5a234836838038e49c91384609b1-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/snake-9a1c5a234836838038e49c91384609b1-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/snake-9a1c5a234836838038e49c91384609b1-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/snake-9a1c5a234836838038e49c91384609b1-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h2>La India Dormida</h2>\\n<p>We’d planned to do the hike up to La India Dormida which we had been told would take a few hours and was pretty steep.

They have two rescued sloths that live in their house which guests can interact with during their stay. A year ago the two sloths had a baby, who also now lives with them. It cost us $55 for the night plus tax, so wasn’t the cheapest place we had stayed but it was worth every cent.</p>\\n<p>After the La India Dormida hike, the heavens opened and it didn’t stop raining until the following day. Harry told us that the sloths are more sleepy when it rains but he would fetch us should they wake up. At around 17:00, he told us he had fed them but they hadn’t really got up but said we could come and have a look anyway. Luckily, the baby sloth was curious and came out from behind the sofa to see what was going on. Harry told us we could feed her some flowers, which was the equivalent of chocolate to sloths. He told us that the ropes and branches extend throughout their house so the sloths can go whereever they like. He showed us some bells on the doorhandles and told us that the mother sloth was really clever and had worked out how to open the doors, so they have had to put bells on them so they can hear at night if she tries to get outside.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/baby-sloth-6a0609b9c7794476db08fb6fd990ef16-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Sloths\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Sloths\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/baby-sloth-6a0609b9c7794476db08fb6fd990ef16-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/baby-sloth-6a0609b9c7794476db08fb6fd990ef16-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/baby-sloth-6a0609b9c7794476db08fb6fd990ef16-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/baby-sloth-6a0609b9c7794476db08fb6fd990ef16-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>The next morning we got up early, hoping that the sloths would get up in the morning sun and to make sure we caught a bus back to the city early enough to get back in time for the England vs Colombia game.

He put them in the trees, they climbed down and hid in the bushes for privacy to use the toilet. We fed them more flowers on the branches before they started to make their way back inside.

Mamallena wasn’t in a very nice area of Panama and the style of the hostel made it feel more like we were by the coast than in the middle of a bustling city.</p>\\n<p>We decided to go to El Valle for a couple of nights and caught the bus for $4.25 (£3.22). Nick and Char decided to join us for a night as we’d decided to do a hike they hadn’t yet done . It took 2.5 hours to get there from the city and we were plesantly suprised as to how quiet and green it was; El Valle turned out to be a beautiful town in the middle of a dormant volcano crater. We stayed the first night in <a href=\\\"https://www.bodhihostels.com\\\">Bodhi Hostel</a> with Nick and Char and made the most of the hostels pancake breakfast and delicious smoothies.</p>\\n<h2>El Serpentario</h2>\\n<p>We had planned to rent bikes and go to a waterfall nearby but as the weather was threatening to rain, after having a look around the local market we headed to the Snake Zoo rescue centre. This was only around a 20 minute walk from the hostel and cost $3 to enter. It wasn’t a very big rescue centre, with a few caiman, turtles and a lot of snakes. The guide told us that sometimes they have rescued sloths there too but at that time they didn’t. He showed us some of the different types of snakes and showed us two vipers, fer-de-lance, the most deadly snake and the most common in Panama. The guide let us hold a rainbow snake which they call Lola and have as a ‘pet’.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/snake-9a1c5a234836838038e49c91384609b1-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Snake\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Snake\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/snake-9a1c5a234836838038e49c91384609b1-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/snake-9a1c5a234836838038e49c91384609b1-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/snake-9a1c5a234836838038e49c91384609b1-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/snake-9a1c5a234836838038e49c91384609b1-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h2>La India Dormida</h2>\\n<p>We’d planned to do the hike up to La India Dormida which we had been told would take a few hours and was pretty steep.

They have two rescued sloths that live in their house which guests can interact with during their stay. A year ago the two sloths had a baby, who also now lives with them. It cost us $55 for the night plus tax, so wasn’t the cheapest place we had stayed but it was worth every cent.</p>\\n<p>After the La India Dormida hike, the heavens opened and it didn’t stop raining until the following day. Harry told us that the sloths are more sleepy when it rains but he would fetch us should they wake up. At around 17:00, he told us he had fed them but they hadn’t really got up but said we could come and have a look anyway. Luckily, the baby sloth was curious and came out from behind the sofa to see what was going on. Harry told us we could feed her some flowers, which was the equivalent of chocolate to sloths. He told us that the ropes and branches extend throughout their house so the sloths can go whereever they like. He showed us some bells on the doorhandles and told us that the mother sloth was really clever and had worked out how to open the doors, so they have had to put bells on them so they can hear at night if she tries to get outside.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/baby-sloth-6a0609b9c7794476db08fb6fd990ef16-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Sloths\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Sloths\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/baby-sloth-6a0609b9c7794476db08fb6fd990ef16-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/baby-sloth-6a0609b9c7794476db08fb6fd990ef16-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/baby-sloth-6a0609b9c7794476db08fb6fd990ef16-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/baby-sloth-6a0609b9c7794476db08fb6fd990ef16-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>The next morning we got up early, hoping that the sloths would get up in the morning sun and to make sure we caught a bus back to the city early enough to get back in time for the England vs Colombia game.

We were surprised by how soft their fur was as it looks really course and how gentle and clever they were.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/sloth-25a5198c50ded347bbb236e4de0a76f2-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Sloths\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Sloths\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/sloth-25a5198c50ded347bbb236e4de0a76f2-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/sloth-25a5198c50ded347bbb236e4de0a76f2-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/sloth-25a5198c50ded347bbb236e4de0a76f2-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/sloth-25a5198c50ded347bbb236e4de0a76f2-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h2>Our verdict on El Valle</h2>\\n<p>We loved El Valle, it was quiet and lush green. Sadly, we had terrible thunderstorms just after we had finished the La India Dormida hike which meant that we weren’t able to expore the local countryside any further.
