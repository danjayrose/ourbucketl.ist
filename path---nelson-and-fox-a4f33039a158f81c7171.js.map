Although it was a lot colder and didn’t have as many creepy crawlies or monkeys, the national park reminded us of Tayrona National Park in Colombia. There are no roads and access to the few holiday homes and camp sites are limited to boats or hiking, so it felt really secluded. There were lots of birds in the park and on our 7km hike, we encountered two Weka’s on the paths. They looked just like ducks, but with a sharper beak and claws and fluffier feathers, a little like a Kiwi bird. The walk itself was really easy and didn’t take us long so we had some time to basque on the beach in the sun before the boat came to pick us up.</p>\\n<h2>Fox Glacier Township</h2>\\n<p>We found a deal on <a href=\\\"www.bookme.co.nz\\\">bookme.nz</a> for a glacier helicopter landing at Fox Glacier which is why we decided to come here rather than Franz Joseph. Frustratingly, the weather was awful in our time at Fox which meant we could not fly. Our schedule was fully booked so we could not stay another day either. The approaching paths to Fox Glacier were flooded as well which meant we had little more to do than wonder around the tiny township. I was now beginning to understand why our hostel was littered with motivational posters on the walls.</p>\\n<p>It was at this point where we were really regretting our decision to not hire a car. Shuttle buses, we felt, were expensive for what they were ($20 per person to local treks) and transport links to Franz Joseph were also limited. Having a car would have given us the flexibility to make the most of the surrounding areas.</p>\\n<p>The only thing of note that we did, besides watching a few episodes of Flight of the Conchords, was our visit to the Glow Worm Forest. As it was the only feasable walk we could do, we strolled around the forest in the day and again at night when the glow worms were visible. We weren’t expecting much so we were pleasantly surprised when we spotted the clusters of glow worms amongst the darkness. They looked like blue stars glittered around the pitch black forest. We couldn’t capture the bright sparks of light on camera so this was one for the memory bank. The Fox Glow Worm Forest was well worth the visit and it was something a little unusual from what we’d done so far. For me, it redeemed what we originally thought was a wasted trip to Fox.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/glow-worm-forest-1f10fd17f46678d8eea9f8fccf9678e8-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Glow worm forest\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Glow worm forest\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/glow-worm-forest-1f10fd17f46678d8eea9f8fccf9678e8-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/glow-worm-forest-1f10fd17f46678d8eea9f8fccf9678e8-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/glow-worm-forest-1f10fd17f46678d8eea9f8fccf9678e8-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/glow-worm-forest-1f10fd17f46678d8eea9f8fccf9678e8-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h2>Our Verdict on Nelson</h2>\\n<p>We had lovely weather, despite the cool air, and Nelson was a nice place to spend a few days as we passed through.

We also saw New Zealand’s most photographed rock, named split apple rock.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/fur-seals-f518dac8ce0740a4b09521adb40b2cf1-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 72.22222222222221%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Fur seals\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Fur seals\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/fur-seals-f518dac8ce0740a4b09521adb40b2cf1-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/fur-seals-f518dac8ce0740a4b09521adb40b2cf1-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/fur-seals-f518dac8ce0740a4b09521adb40b2cf1-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/fur-seals-f518dac8ce0740a4b09521adb40b2cf1-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>We were dropped off at Apple Tree Bay for our hike to Anchorage where the boat would pick us up. Although it was a lot colder and didn’t have as many creepy crawlies or monkeys, the national park reminded us of Tayrona National Park in Colombia. There are no roads and access to the few holiday homes and camp sites are limited to boats or hiking, so it felt really secluded. There were lots of birds in the park and on our 7km hike, we encountered two Weka’s on the paths. They looked just like ducks, but with a sharper beak and claws and fluffier feathers, a little like a Kiwi bird. The walk itself was really easy and didn’t take us long so we had some time to basque on the beach in the sun before the boat came to pick us up.</p>\\n<h2>Fox Glacier Township</h2>\\n<p>We found a deal on <a href=\\\"www.bookme.co.nz\\\">bookme.nz</a> for a glacier helicopter landing at Fox Glacier which is why we decided to come here rather than Franz Joseph. Frustratingly, the weather was awful in our time at Fox which meant we could not fly. Our schedule was fully booked so we could not stay another day either. The approaching paths to Fox Glacier were flooded as well which meant we had little more to do than wonder around the tiny township. I was now beginning to understand why our hostel was littered with motivational posters on the walls.</p>\\n<p>It was at this point where we were really regretting our decision to not hire a car. Shuttle buses, we felt, were expensive for what they were ($20 per person to local treks) and transport links to Franz Joseph were also limited. Having a car would have given us the flexibility to make the most of the surrounding areas.</p>\\n<p>The only thing of note that we did, besides watching a few episodes of Flight of the Conchords, was our visit to the Glow Worm Forest. As it was the only feasable walk we could do, we strolled around the forest in the day and again at night when the glow worms were visible. We weren’t expecting much so we were pleasantly surprised when we spotted the clusters of glow worms amongst the darkness. They looked like blue stars glittered around the pitch black forest. We couldn’t capture the bright sparks of light on camera so this was one for the memory bank. The Fox Glow Worm Forest was well worth the visit and it was something a little unusual from what we’d done so far. For me, it redeemed what we originally thought was a wasted trip to Fox.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/glow-worm-forest-1f10fd17f46678d8eea9f8fccf9678e8-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAQX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB5D0UwwiD/8QAGxAAAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAxMhIjH/2gAIAQEAAQUCi9XIvEO1Mo//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/AT//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEf/aAAgBAgEBPwGI/8QAFRABAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASD/2gAIAQEABj8CK//EABwQAQACAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAERAhMUFhgf/aAAgBAQABPyGjoZe81EWqOsO6Dxx//9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABAML//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8QP//EABYRAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEf/aAAgBAgEBPxB0yD//xAAaEAEAAwADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMVGR/9oACAEBAAE/EK3eLnUUBKNBIxiVboQTwTuAJxyI45Xk/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Glow worm forest\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Glow worm forest\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/glow-worm-forest-1f10fd17f46678d8eea9f8fccf9678e8-769ec.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/glow-worm-forest-1f10fd17f46678d8eea9f8fccf9678e8-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\\n/static/glow-worm-forest-1f10fd17f46678d8eea9f8fccf9678e8-ac97c.jpg 450w,\\n/static/glow-worm-forest-1f10fd17f46678d8eea9f8fccf9678e8-769ec.jpg 900w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h2>Our Verdict on Nelson</h2>\\n<p>We had lovely weather, despite the cool air, and Nelson was a nice place to spend a few days as we passed through.
