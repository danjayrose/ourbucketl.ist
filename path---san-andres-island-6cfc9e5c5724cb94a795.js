Although it’s a Colombian Island, San Andrés is located closer to Nicaragua than Colombia. We had to prove we had a flight off the island and out of Colombia in order to board the plane. And, as San Andrés is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, called “Seaflower Biosphere Reserve”, we had to pay 106,000COP (£28) each just to enter the island. We’d met a Dutch restuarant owner in Cartagena who had visted San Andrés whilst we were in Santa Marta. When we went back to his restaurant, he told us that the weather had been bad as it was the start of rainy season and he told us that there are lots of police on the island as it used to be linked with narco trafficking. He was right about the police, but wrong about the weather. We were lucky to have blazing hot sun every day but one that we were on the island.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/rainy-season-37ced6d8d2b73e3bd1c8af85e646bb14-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Rainy Season"\n        title="Rainy Season"\n        src="/static/rainy-season-37ced6d8d2b73e3bd1c8af85e646bb14-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/rainy-season-37ced6d8d2b73e3bd1c8af85e646bb14-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/rainy-season-37ced6d8d2b73e3bd1c8af85e646bb14-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/rainy-season-37ced6d8d2b73e3bd1c8af85e646bb14-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>El Centro</h2>\n<p>We didn’t do a lot in the time we spent on San Andrés Island other than napping on the beach, drinking and watching the World Cup.

It was built up a cliff face that was full of iguanas and the hostel owner had two very cute dogs! El Centro was full of duty free shops depite lacking in restaurants, although we didn’t really find the prices any cheaper than elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The centre also had a typical ‘I love San Andrés’ sign which was always busy with tourists. There were also statues of Captain Morgan, a pirate thought to have made his base on the island, stealing gold from Spanish ships passing through the Carribean during the time of the Spanish conquest. People believe that the gold is still buried somewhere on the island.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/sign-bdbe2d44cb9e1d4cdee32eb5682696f6-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="San Andrés Sign"\n        title="San Andrés Sign"\n        src="/static/sign-bdbe2d44cb9e1d4cdee32eb5682696f6-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/sign-bdbe2d44cb9e1d4cdee32eb5682696f6-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/sign-bdbe2d44cb9e1d4cdee32eb5682696f6-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/sign-bdbe2d44cb9e1d4cdee32eb5682696f6-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>One thing we really wanted to do was rent a golf buggy and drive around the island. We’d read that it takes around 3 hours to get around the whole of San Andrés island and there were numerous things to see, the oldest church, a blow hole, some other more secluded beaches and a lake. However, we knew it would be a recipe for disaster, trying to drive and navigate on the wrong side of the road so we opted for a day trip out to some of the smaller islands instead.</p>\n<h2>Snorkelling</h2>\n<p>On Greeno’s penultimate day we did a snorkelling trip around the coral reefs. We found <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g3493965-d10840302-Reviews-Caribe_Extremo-San_Andres_San_Andres_Island_San_Andres_and_Providencia_Departme.html">Caribe Extremo</a> owned by Fernando on Trip Advisor, he had really great reviews and would only take out groups of 2-4 people for £18 each. We met him at 09:00, he gave us good snorkelling gear and took us out from the island around ten minutes away, we were the only ones by that part of the reef. The sea was really shallow and it didn’t take long before we saw two big eagle rays swimming just off the reef. In the hour we were swimming we saw three more eagle rays, two sting rays, a lobster, a crab, an octopus, lots of colourful fish and coral! The boys were able to hold their breath and go under water trying to get closer to the marine life for a good picture.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/eagle-rays-722d6c0399f9e8b0bcdac4c4d80b54bf-769ec.jpg"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 900px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 75.11111111111111%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Eagle rays"\n        title="Eagle rays"\n        src="/static/eagle-rays-722d6c0399f9e8b0bcdac4c4d80b54bf-769ec.jpg"\n        srcset="/static/eagle-rays-722d6c0399f9e8b0bcdac4c4d80b54bf-d9ef2.jpg 225w,\n/static/eagle-rays-722d6c0399f9e8b0bcdac4c4d80b54bf-ac97c.jpg 450w,\n/static/eagle-rays-722d6c0399f9e8b0bcdac4c4d80b54bf-769ec.jpg 900w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h2>Johnny Cay</h2>\n<p>Johnny Cay is an island just off the coast of San Andrés. For £7 we took a boat to see a rusty ship stuck on the coral, stopping at Rose Cay, Haynes Cay and Johnny Cay. On Rose Cay we were able to snorkel in the natural aquarium. The water was shallow and warm but it was so busy compared to the snorkelling trip we had taken the day before and there were just a few colourful fish to see.
